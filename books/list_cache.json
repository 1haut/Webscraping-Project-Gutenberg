Some years ago\u2014never mind how long\r\nprecisely\u2014having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular\r\nto interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the\r\nwatery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and\r\nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the\r\nmouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find\r\nmyself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear\r\nof every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper\r\nhand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from\r\ndeliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people\u2019s\r\nhats off\u2014then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.\r\nThis is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato\r\nthrows himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing\r\nsurprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some\r\ntime or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\r\n\n\r\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as\r\nIndian isles by coral reefs\u2014commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right\r\nand left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery,\r\nwhere that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few\r\nhours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers\r\nthere.\r\n\n\r\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to\r\nCoenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall northward. What do you\r\nsee?\u2014Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands\r\nupon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the\r\nspiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of\r\nships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still\r\nbetter seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath\r\nand plaster\u2014tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How\r\nthen is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?\r\n\n\r\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly\r\nbound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of\r\nthe land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.\r\nNo. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling\r\nin. And there they stand\u2014miles of them\u2014leagues. Inlanders all, they\r\ncome from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues,\u2014north, east, south, and\r\nwest. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles\r\nof the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?\r\n\n\r\nOnce more. Say, you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost\r\nany path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves\r\nyou there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most\r\nabsent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries\u2014stand that man on\r\nhis legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if\r\nwater there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great\r\nAmerican desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied\r\nwith a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water\r\nare wedded for ever.\r\n\n\r\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\r\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the\r\nSaco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a\r\nhollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his\r\nmeadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy\r\nsmoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping\r\nspurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies\r\nthus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon\r\nthis shepherd\u2019s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd\u2019s eye\r\nwere fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,\r\nwhen for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among\r\nTiger-lilies\u2014what is the one charm wanting?\u2014Water\u2014there is\r\nnot a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you\r\ntravel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon\r\nsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a\r\ncoat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to\r\nRockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy\r\nsoul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first\r\nvoyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when\r\nfirst told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the\r\nold Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity,\r\nand own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still\r\ndeeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp\r\nthe tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was\r\ndrowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is\r\nthe image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\r\n\n\r\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow\r\nhazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean\r\nto have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a\r\npassenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have\r\nsomething in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick\u2014grow\r\nquarrelsome\u2014don\u2019t sleep of nights\u2014do not enjoy themselves\r\nmuch, as a general thing;\u2014no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am\r\nsomething of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a\r\nCook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like\r\nthem. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable toils, trials, and\r\ntribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take\r\ncare of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and\r\nwhat not. And as for going as cook,\u2014though I confess there is\r\nconsiderable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on\r\nship-board\u2014yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;\u2014though\r\nonce broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered,\r\nthere is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of\r\na broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\r\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies\r\nof those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\r\n\n\r\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb\r\ndown into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather\r\norder me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in\r\na May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches\r\none\u2019s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established\r\nfamily in the land, the van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And\r\nmore than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have\r\nbeen lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe\r\nof you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from the schoolmaster to a\r\nsailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you\r\nto grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.\r\n\n\r\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and\r\nsweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in\r\nthe scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks\r\nanything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old\r\nhunks in that particular instance? Who aint a slave? Tell me that. Well, then,\r\nhowever the old sea-captains may order me about\u2014however they may thump\r\nand punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;\r\nthat everybody else is one way or other served in much the same\r\nway\u2014either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so\r\nthe universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each\r\nother\u2019s shoulder-blades, and be content.\r\n\n\r\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me\r\nfor my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever\r\nheard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the\r\ndifference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is\r\nperhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed\r\nupon us. But being paid,\u2014what will compare with it? The urbane\r\nactivity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that\r\nwe so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on\r\nno account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign\r\nourselves to perdition!\r\n\n\r\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and\r\npure air of the forecastle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more\r\nprevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean\r\nmaxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his\r\natmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he\r\nbreathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead\r\ntheir leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little\r\nsuspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as\r\na merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage;\r\nthis the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant\r\nsurveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some\r\nunaccountable way\u2014he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless,\r\nmy going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of\r\nProvidence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief\r\ninterlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this\r\npart of the bill must have run something like this:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGrand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.\r\n\u201cWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.\r\n\u201cBLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates,\r\nput me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down\r\nfor magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel\r\ncomedies, and jolly parts in farces\u2014though I cannot tell why this was\r\nexactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a\r\nlittle into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under\r\nvarious disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides\r\ncajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own\r\nunbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.\r\n\n\r\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself.\r\nSuch a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild\r\nand distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless\r\nperils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand\r\nPatagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men,\r\nperhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am\r\ntormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden\r\nseas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\r\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with it\u2014would they let\r\nme\u2014since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of\r\nthe place one lodges in.\r\n\n\r\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great\r\nflood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that\r\nswayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless\r\nprocessions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom,\r\nlike a snow hill in the air.CHAPTER II.THE CARPET-BAG\n\r\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and\r\nstarted for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto,\r\nI duly arrived in New Bedford. It was on a Saturday night in December. Much was\r\nI disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already\r\nsailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following\r\nMonday.\r\n\n\r\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this\r\nsame New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related\r\nthat I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no\r\nother than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something\r\nabout everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased\r\nme. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the\r\nbusiness of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much\r\nbehind her, yet Nantucket was her great original\u2014the Tyre of this\r\nCarthage;\u2014the place where the first dead American whale was stranded.\r\nWhere else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first\r\nsally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from\r\nNantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden\r\nwith imported cobble-stones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the\r\nwhales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from\r\nthe bowsprit?\r\n\n\r\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New\r\nBedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of\r\nconcernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very\r\ndubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and\r\ncheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my\r\npocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,\u2014So, wherever you go,\r\nIshmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street\r\nshouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness\r\ntowards the south\u2014wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for\r\nthe night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don\u2019t be\r\ntoo particular.\r\n\n\r\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \u201cThe\r\nCrossed Harpoons\u201d\u2014but it looked too expensive and jolly there.\r\nFurther on, from the bright red windows of the \u201cSword-Fish Inn,\u201d\r\nthere came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\r\nice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten\r\ninches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,\u2014rather weary for me, when I\r\nstruck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless\r\nservice the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight. Too expensive\r\nand jolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the\r\nstreet, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael,\r\nsaid I at last; don\u2019t you hear? get away from before the door; your\r\npatched boots are stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed\r\nthe streets that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if\r\nnot the cheeriest inns.\r\n\n\r\nSuch dreary streets! Blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here\r\nand there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the\r\nnight, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but\r\ndeserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide\r\nbuilding, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as\r\nif it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I\r\ndid was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the\r\nflying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\r\nGomorrah? But \u201cThe Crossed Harpoons,\u201d and \u201cThe\r\nSword-Fish?\u201d\u2014this, then, must needs be the sign of \u201cThe\r\nTrap.\u201d However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within,\r\npushed on and opened a second, interior door.\r\n\n\r\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces\r\nturned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was\r\nbeating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacher\u2019s\r\ntext was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and\r\nteeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched\r\nentertainment at the sign of \u201cThe Trap!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and\r\nheard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over\r\nthe door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight\r\njet of misty spray, and these words underneath\u2014\u201cThe\r\nSpouter-Inn:\u2014Peter Coffin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nCoffin?\u2014Spouter?\u2014Rather ominous in that particular connexion,\r\nthought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this\r\nPeter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the\r\nplace, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden\r\nhouse itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some\r\nburnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak\r\nto it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best\r\nof pea coffee.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a queer sort of place\u2014a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as\r\nit were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that\r\ntempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor\r\nPaul\u2019s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant\r\nzephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.\r\n\u201cIn judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,\u201d says an\r\nold writer\u2014of whose works I possess the only copy extant\u2014\u201cit\r\nmaketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass\r\nwindow where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from\r\nthat sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight\r\nDeath is the only glazier.\u201d True enough, thought I, as this passage\r\noccurred to my mind\u2014old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these\r\neyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they\r\ndidn\u2019t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little\r\nlint here and there. But it\u2019s too late to make any improvements now. The\r\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a\r\nmillion years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the\r\ncurbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he\r\nmight plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet\r\nthat would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives,\r\nin his red silken wrapper\u2014(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh!\r\nWhat a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them\r\ntalk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\r\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\r\n\n\r\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the\r\ngrand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would\r\nhe not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea,\r\nye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?\r\n\n\r\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of\r\nDives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of\r\nthe Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made\r\nof frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks\r\nthe tepid tears of orphans.\r\n\n\r\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty\r\nof that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what\r\nsort of a place this \u201cSpouter\u201d may be.CHAPTER III.THE SPOUTER-INN\n\r\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low,\r\nstraggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of\r\nsome condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oil-painting so\r\nthoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal cross-lights by\r\nwhich you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic\r\nvisits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way\r\narrive at an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades\r\nand shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in\r\nthe time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched.\r\nBut by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\r\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry,\r\nyou at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not\r\nbe altogether unwarranted.\r\n\n\r\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black\r\nmass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim,\r\nperpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy\r\npicture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort\r\nof indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze\r\nyou to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\r\nthat marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive\r\nidea would dart you through.\u2014It\u2019s the Black Sea in a midnight\r\ngale.\u2014It\u2019s the unnatural combat of the four primal\r\nelements.\u2014It\u2019s a blasted heath.\u2014It\u2019s a Hyperborean\r\nwinter scene.\u2014It\u2019s the breaking-up of the ice-bound stream of Time.\r\nBut at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the\r\npicture\u2019s midst. That once found out, and all the rest were plain.\r\nBut stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the\r\ngreat leviathan himself?\r\n\n\r\nIn fact, the artist\u2019s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\r\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I\r\nconversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great\r\nhurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled\r\nmasts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over\r\nthe craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three\r\nmast-heads.\r\n\n\r\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of\r\nmonstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth\r\nresembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was\r\nsickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the\r\nnew-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered\r\nwhat monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with\r\nsuch a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling\r\nlances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\r\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill\r\nfifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon\u2014so like a\r\ncorkscrew now\u2014was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale,\r\nyears afterward slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh\r\nthe tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,\r\ntravelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.\r\n\n\r\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way\u2014cut through\r\nwhat in old times must have been a great central chimney with fire-places all\r\nround\u2014you enter the public room. A still duskier place is this, with such\r\nlow ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would\r\nalmost fancy you trod some old craft\u2019s cockpits, especially of such a\r\nhowling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one\r\nside stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases,\r\nfilled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world\u2019s remotest\r\nnooks. Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking\r\nden\u2014the bar\u2014a rude attempt at a right whale\u2019s head. Be that\r\nhow it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale\u2019s jaw, so\r\nwide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged\r\nround with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift\r\ndestruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\r\nbustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the\r\nsailors deliriums and death.\r\n\n\r\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\r\ncylinders without\u2014within, the villanous green goggling glasses\r\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely\r\npecked into the glass, surround these footpads\u2019 goblets. Fill to\r\nthis mark, and your charge is but a penny; to this a penny more;\r\nand so on to the full glass\u2014the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp\r\ndown for a shilling.\r\n\n\r\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a\r\ntable, examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander. I\r\nsought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room,\r\nreceived for answer that his house was full\u2014not a bed unoccupied.\r\n\u201cBut avast,\u201d he added, tapping his forehead, \u201cyou haint no\r\nobjections to sharing a harpooneer\u2019s blanket, have ye? I s\u2019pose you\r\nare goin\u2019 a whalin\u2019, so you\u2019d better get used to that sort of\r\nthing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do\r\nso, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he (the\r\nlandlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not\r\ndecidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a strange town on\r\nso bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decent man\u2019s\r\nblanket.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?\u2014you want supper?\r\nSupper \u2019ll be ready directly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\r\nBattery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his\r\njack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his\r\nlegs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn\u2019t\r\nmake much headway, I thought.\r\n\n\r\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room.\r\nIt was cold as Iceland\u2014no fire at all\u2014the landlord said he\r\ncouldn\u2019t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\r\nwinding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our\r\nlips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare was of the\r\nmost substantial kind\u2014not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good\r\nheavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed\r\nhimself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy boy,\u201d said the landlord, \u201cyou\u2019ll have the nightmare\r\nto a dead sartainty.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLandlord,\u201d I whispered, \u201cthat aint the harpooneer, is\r\nit?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \u201cthe\r\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he\r\ndon\u2019t\u2014he eats nothing but steaks, and likes \u2019em rare.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe devil he does,\u201d says I. \u201cWhere is that harpooneer? Is he\r\nhere?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be here afore long,\u201d was the answer.\r\n\n\r\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \u201cdark\r\ncomplexioned\u201d harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so\r\nturned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed\r\nbefore I did.\r\n\n\r\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else\r\nto do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on.\r\n\n\r\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord cried,\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Grampus\u2019s crew. I seed her reported in the offing\r\nthis morning; a three years\u2019 voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now\r\nwe\u2019ll have the latest news from the Feegees.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and in\r\nrolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats,\r\nand with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged,\r\nand their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from\r\nLabrador. They had just landed from their boat, and this was the first house\r\nthey entered. No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\r\nwhale\u2019s mouth\u2014the bar\u2014when the wrinkled little old Jonah,\r\nthere officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round. One complained of a\r\nbad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and\r\nmolasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs\r\nwhatsoever, never mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of\r\nLabrador, or on the weather side of an ice-island.\r\n\n\r\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with the\r\narrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most\r\nobstreperously.\r\n\n\r\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed\r\ndesirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet\r\nupon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This man\r\ninterested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon\r\nbecome my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative\r\nis concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood\r\nfull six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\r\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,\r\nmaking his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of\r\nhis eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His\r\nvoice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\r\nthought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleganian Ridge in\r\nVirginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this\r\nman slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade\r\non the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and\r\nbeing, it seems, for some reason a huge favorite with them, they raised a cry\r\nof \u201cBulkington! Bulkington! where\u2019s Bulkington?\u201d and darted\r\nout of the house in pursuit of him.\r\n\n\r\nIt was now about nine o\u2019clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally\r\nquiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan\r\nthat had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.\r\n\n\r\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not\r\nsleep with your own brother. I don\u2019t know how it is, but people like to\r\nbe private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an\r\nunknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a\r\nharpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any\r\nearthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody\r\nelse; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do\r\nashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your\r\nown hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own\r\nskin.\r\n\n\r\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of\r\nsleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or\r\nwoollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of\r\nthe finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my\r\ndecent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should\r\ntumble in upon me at midnight\u2014how could I tell from what vile hole he had\r\nbeen coming?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLandlord! I\u2019ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.\u2014I\r\nshan\u2019t sleep with him. I\u2019ll try the bench here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust as you please; I\u2019m sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\r\nmattress, and it\u2019s a plaguy rough board here\u201d\u2014feeling of the\r\nknots and notches. \u201cBut wait a bit, Skrimshander; I\u2019ve got a\r\ncarpenter\u2019s plane there in the bar\u2014wait, I say, and I\u2019ll make\r\nye snug enough.\u201d So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk\r\nhandkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\r\nthe while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last\r\nthe plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near\r\nspraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven\u2019s sake to quit\u2014the\r\nbed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the\r\nworld could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with\r\nanother grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room,\r\nhe went about his business, and left me in a brown study.\r\n\n\r\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short;\r\nbut that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the\r\nother bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed\r\none\u2014so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first bench lengthwise\r\nalong the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between,\r\nfor my back to settle down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught\r\nof cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would\r\nnever do at all, especially as another current from the rickety door met the\r\none from the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.\r\n\n\r\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn\u2019t I steal a\r\nmarch on him\u2014bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\r\nwakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon second\r\nthoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon\r\nas I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all\r\nready to knock me down!\r\n\n\r\nStill, looking around me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a\r\nsufferable night unless in some other person\u2019s bed, I began to think that\r\nafter all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown\r\nharpooneer. Thinks I, I\u2019ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before\r\nlong. I\u2019ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly\r\ngood bedfellows after all\u2014there\u2019s no telling.\r\n\n\r\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and\r\ngoing to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLandlord!\u201d said I, \u201cwhat sort of a chap is he\u2014does he\r\nalways keep such late hours?\u201d It was now hard upon twelve o\u2019clock.\r\n\n\r\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily\r\ntickled at something beyond my comprehension. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered,\r\n\u201cgenerally he\u2019s an early bird\u2014airley to bed and airley to\r\nrise\u2014yes, he\u2019s the bird what catches the worm.\u2014But to-night\r\nhe went out a peddling, you see, and I don\u2019t see what on airth keeps him\r\nso late, unless, may be, he can\u2019t sell his head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t sell his head?\u2014What sort of a bamboozingly story is\r\nthis you are telling me?\u201d getting into a towering rage. \u201cDo you\r\npretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\r\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this\r\ntown?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s precisely it,\u201d said the landlord, \u201cand I told\r\nhim he couldn\u2019t sell it here, the market\u2019s overstocked.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith what?\u201d shouted I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith heads to be sure; ain\u2019t there too many heads in the\r\nworld?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI tell you what it is, landlord,\u201d said I, quite calmly,\r\n\u201cyou\u2019d better stop spinning that yarn to me\u2014I\u2019m not\r\ngreen.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMay be not,\u201d taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick,\r\n\u201cbut I rayther guess you\u2019ll be done brown if that ere\r\nharpooneer hears you a slanderin\u2019 his head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll break it for him,\u201d said I, now flying into a passion\r\nagain at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord\u2019s.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s broke a\u2019ready,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBroke,\u201d said I\u2014\u201cbroke, do you mean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSartain, and that\u2019s the very reason he can\u2019t sell it, I\r\nguess.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLandlord,\u201d said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow\r\nstorm,\u2014\u201clandlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\r\nanother, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you\r\ntell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a\r\ncertain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you\r\npersist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories, tending to\r\nbeget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my\r\nbedfellow\u2014a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and\r\nconfidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak out and\r\ntell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects\r\nsafe to spend the night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good\r\nas to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\r\nevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I\u2019ve no idea of sleeping\r\nwith a madman; and you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by\r\ntrying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to\r\na criminal prosecution.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWall,\u201d said the landlord, fetching a long breath,\r\n\u201cthat\u2019s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and\r\nthen. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin\u2019 you\r\nof has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of\r\n\u2019balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he\u2019s sold\r\nall on \u2019em but one, and that one he\u2019s trying to sell to-night,\r\ncause to-morrow\u2019s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin\u2019 human\r\nheads about the streets when folks is goin\u2019 to churches. He wanted to,\r\nlast Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin\u2019 out of the door with\r\nfour heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of\r\ninions.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that\r\nthe landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me\u2014but at the same\r\ntime what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out a Saturday night clean\r\ninto the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads\r\nof dead idolators?\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDepend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe pays reg\u2019lar,\u201d was the rejoinder. \u201cBut come,\r\nit\u2019s getting dreadful late, you had better be turning\r\nflukes\u2014it\u2019s a nice bed: Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night\r\nwe were spliced. There\u2019s plenty room for two to kick about in that bed;\r\nit\u2019s an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put\r\nour Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling\r\nabout one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near\r\nbreaking his arm. After that, Sal said it wouldn\u2019t do. Come along here,\r\nI\u2019ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\u201d and so saying he lighted a candle\r\nand held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when\r\nlooking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed \u201cI vum it\u2019s\r\nSunday\u2014you won\u2019t see that harpooneer to-night; he\u2019s come to\r\nanchor somewhere\u2014come along then; do come; won\u2019t ye\r\ncome?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered\r\ninto a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a\r\nprodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep\r\nabreast.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\r\nchest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \u201cthere, make\r\nyourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\u201d I turned round from\r\neyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\r\n\n\r\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most\r\nelegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the\r\nroom; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture\r\nbelonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered\r\nfireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging\r\nto the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\r\ncorner; also a large seaman\u2019s bag, containing the harpooneer\u2019s\r\nwardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of\r\noutlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\r\nstanding at the head of the bed.\r\n\n\r\nBut what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light,\r\nand felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some\r\nsatisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large\r\ndoor mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the\r\nstained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in\r\nthe middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But\r\ncould it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and\r\nparade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\r\ntry it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and\r\nthick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had\r\nbeen wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against\r\nthe wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in\r\nsuch a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\r\n\n\r\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\r\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the\r\nbed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle\r\nof the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my\r\nshirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was,\r\nand remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer\u2019s not coming\r\nhome at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped\r\nout of my pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\r\nbed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\r\n\n\r\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is\r\nno telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long\r\ntime. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good\r\noffing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage,\r\nand saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.\r\n\n\r\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler.\r\nBut I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to.\r\nHolding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other,\r\nthe stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his\r\ncandle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began\r\nworking away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being\r\nin the room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for\r\nsome time while employed in unlacing the bag\u2019s mouth. This accomplished,\r\nhowever, he turned round\u2014when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face!\r\nIt was of a dark purplish, yellow color, here and there stuck over with large,\r\nblackish looking squares. Yes, it\u2019s just as I thought, he\u2019s a\r\nterrible bedfellow; he\u2019s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he\r\nis, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so\r\ntowards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at\r\nall, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other.\r\nAt first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth\r\noccurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man\u2014a whaleman\r\ntoo\u2014who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I\r\nconcluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have\r\nmet with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It\u2019s\r\nonly his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to\r\nmake of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,\r\nand completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\r\nnothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\r\nsun\u2019s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\r\nnever been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\r\nextraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing\r\nthrough me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after\r\nsome difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and\r\npresently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\r\non. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the\r\nNew Zealand head\u2014a ghastly thing enough\u2014and crammed it down into\r\nthe bag. He now took off his hat\u2014a new beaver hat\u2014when I came nigh\r\nsinging out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head\u2014none to\r\nspeak of at least\u2014nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his\r\nforehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed\r\nskull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted\r\nout of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.\r\n\n\r\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was\r\nthe second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling\r\npurple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of\r\nfear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I\r\nconfess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had\r\nthus broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him\r\nthat I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory\r\nanswer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his\r\nchest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the\r\nsame squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he\r\nseemed to have been in a Thirty Years\u2019 War, and just escaped from it with\r\na sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel\r\nof dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite\r\nplain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a\r\nwhaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked\r\nto think of it. A peddler of heads too\u2014perhaps the heads of his own\r\nbrothers. He might take a fancy to mine\u2014heavens! look at that tomahawk!\r\n\n\r\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something\r\nthat completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed\r\nbe a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he\r\nhad previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at\r\nlength a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly\r\nthe color of a three days\u2019 old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head,\r\nat first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in\r\nsome similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it\r\nglistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\r\nbut a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to\r\nthe empty fireplace, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little\r\nhunchbacked image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and\r\nall the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a\r\nvery appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\r\n\n\r\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at\r\nease meantime\u2014to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a\r\ndouble handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully\r\nbefore the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the\r\nflame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze.\r\nPresently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier\r\nwithdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he\r\nat last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and\r\nashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the\r\nlittle devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved\r\nhis lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural\r\nnoises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else\r\nsinging some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in\r\nthe most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up\r\nvery unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as\r\nif he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\r\n\n\r\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now\r\nexhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping\r\ninto bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light\r\nwas put out, to break the spell into which I had so long been bound.\r\n\n\r\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking\r\nup his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and\r\nthen holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great\r\nclouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this\r\nwild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out,\r\nI could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\r\nfeeling me.\r\n\n\r\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the\r\nwall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet,\r\nand let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses\r\nsatisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho-e debel you?\u201d\u2014he at last said\u2014\u201cyou no\r\nspeak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\u201d And so saying the lighted tomahawk began\r\nflourishing about me in the dark.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLandlord, for God\u2019s sake, Peter Coffin!\u201d shouted I.\r\n\u201cLandlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpeak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\u201d again growled\r\nthe cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot\r\ntobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank\r\nheaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and\r\nleaping from the bed I ran up to him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid now,\u201d said he, grinning again.\r\n\u201cQueequeg here wouldn\u2019t harm a hair of your head.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStop your grinning,\u201d shouted I, \u201cand why didn\u2019t you\r\ntell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought ye know\u2019d it;\u2014didn\u2019t I tell ye, he was\r\npeddlin\u2019 heads around town?\u2014but turn flukes again and go to sleep.\r\nQueequeg, look here\u2014you sabbee me, I sabbee you\u2014this man sleepe\r\nyou\u2014you sabbee?\u201d\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMe sabbee plenty\u201d\u2014grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe\r\nand sitting up in bed.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou gettee in,\u201d he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\r\nthrowing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a\r\nreally kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his\r\ntattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What\u2019s\r\nall this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself\u2014the\r\nman\u2019s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me,\r\nas I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a\r\ndrunken Christian.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLandlord,\u201d said I, \u201ctell him to stash his tomahawk there, or\r\npipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\r\nturn in with him. But I don\u2019t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.\r\nIt\u2019s dangerous. Besides, I aint insured.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned\r\nme to get into bed\u2014rolling over to one side as much as to say\u2014I\r\nwont touch a leg of ye.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood night, landlord,\u201d said I, \u201cyou may go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.CHAPTER IV.THE COUNTERPANE\n\r\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\u2019s arm thrown\r\nover me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought I\r\nhad been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little\r\nparti-colored squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with\r\nan interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one\r\nprecise shade\u2014owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea\r\nunmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at\r\nvarious times\u2014this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like\r\na strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did\r\nwhen I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended\r\ntheir hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\r\ncould tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\r\n\n\r\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a child, I\r\nwell remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was a\r\nreality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The circumstance was this. I\r\nhad been cutting up some caper or other\u2014I think it was trying to crawl up\r\nthe chimney, as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my\r\nstepmother who, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me\r\nto bed supperless,\u2014my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney\r\nand packed me off to bed, though it was only two o\u2019clock in the afternoon\r\nof the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt\r\ndreadfully. But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room\r\nin the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\r\nand with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\r\n\n\r\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I\r\ncould hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached\r\nto think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and\r\na great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all\r\nover the house. I felt worse and worse\u2014at last I got up, dressed, and\r\nsoftly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly\r\nthrew myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favor to give me a\r\ngood slippering for my misbehavior; anything indeed but condemning me to lie\r\nabed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most\r\nconscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several\r\nhours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done\r\nsince, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have\r\nfallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from\r\nit\u2014half steeped in dreams\u2014I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit\r\nroom was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running\r\nthrough all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but\r\na supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,\r\nand the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand\r\nbelonged, seemed closely seated by my bedside. For what seemed ages piled on\r\nages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my\r\nhand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\r\nspell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away\r\nfrom me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for\r\ndays and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to\r\nexplain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it.\r\n\n\r\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural\r\nhand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I\r\nexperienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\u2019s pagan arm thrown round me.\r\nBut at length all the past night\u2019s events soberly recurred, one by one,\r\nin fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament. For\r\nthough I tried to move his arm\u2014unlock his bridegroom clasp\u2014yet,\r\nsleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as though naught but death\r\nshould part us twain. I now strove to rouse\r\nhim\u2014\u201cQueequeg!\u201d\u2014but his only answer was a snore. I then\r\nrolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt\r\na slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\r\nsleeping by the savage\u2019s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\r\npretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day,\r\nwith a cannibal and a tomahawk! \u201cQueequeg!\u2014in the name of goodness,\r\nQueequeg, wake!\u201d At length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and\r\nincessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\r\nin that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and\r\npresently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog\r\njust from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me,\r\nand rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be\r\nthere, though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly\r\ndawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious\r\nmisgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When,\r\nat last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and\r\nhe became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor,\r\nand by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me,\r\nhe would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\r\napartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a\r\nvery civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense\r\nof delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they\r\nare. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with\r\nso much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\r\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the\r\ntime my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man like\r\nQueequeg you don\u2019t see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual\r\nregarding.\r\n\n\r\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one, by the\r\nby, and then\u2014still minus his trowsers\u2014he hunted up his boots. What\r\nunder the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to\r\ncrush himself\u2014boots in hand, and hat on\u2014under the bed; when, from\r\nsundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting\r\nhimself; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man\r\nrequired to be private when putting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was\r\na creature in the transition state\u2014neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He\r\nwas just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\r\npossible manner. His education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate.\r\nIf he had not been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have\r\ntroubled himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a\r\nsavage, he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\r\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes,\r\nand began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\r\nto boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones\u2014probably not made to\r\norder either\u2014rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a\r\nbitter cold morning.\r\n\n\r\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street\r\nbeing very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room, and\r\nobserving more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving about\r\nwith little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to\r\naccelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as\r\nsoon as possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time\r\nin the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\r\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms,\r\nand hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on\r\nthe wash-stand centre-table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his\r\nface. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\r\ntakes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock,\r\nunsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit\r\nof mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of\r\nhis cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers\u2019s best cutlery with\r\na vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to\r\nknow of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly\r\nsharp the long straight edges are always kept.\r\n\n\r\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of the\r\nroom, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his harpoon\r\nlike a marshal\u2019s baton.CHAPTER V.BREAKFAST\n\r\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning\r\nlandlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him, though he had been\r\nskylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow.\r\n\n\r\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good\r\nthing; the more\u2019s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person,\r\nafford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him\r\ncheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the man that\r\nhas anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man\r\nthan you perhaps think for.\r\n\n\r\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night\r\nprevious, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were nearly all\r\nwhalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters,\r\nand sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a\r\nbrown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all\r\nwearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.\r\n\n\r\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This young\r\nfellow\u2019s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem\r\nto smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian\r\nvoyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch of\r\nsatin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn,\r\nbut slightly bleached withal; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But\r\nwho could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed\r\nlike the Andes\u2019 western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting\r\nclimates, zone by zone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGrub, ho!\u201d now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we\r\nwent to breakfast.\r\n\n\r\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in\r\nmanner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the great\r\nNew England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they\r\npossessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere crossing of\r\nSiberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary\r\nwalk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of\r\npoor Mungo\u2019s performances\u2014this kind of travel, I say, may not be\r\nthe very best mode of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part,\r\nthat sort of thing is to be had anywhere.\r\n\n\r\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we\r\nwere all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good stories\r\nabout whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man maintained a profound\r\nsilence. And not only that, but they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were a set\r\nof sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great\r\nwhales on the high seas\u2014entire strangers to them\u2014and duelled them\r\ndead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast\r\ntable\u2014all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes\u2014looking round\r\nas sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some\r\nsheepfold among the Green Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears,\r\nthese timid warrior whalemen!\r\n\n\r\nBut as for Queequeg\u2014why, Queequeg sat there among them\u2014at the head\r\nof the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I cannot say\r\nmuch for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified\r\nhis bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there without\r\nceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many\r\nheads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him. But that was certainly\r\nvery coolly done by him, and every one knows that in most people\u2019s\r\nestimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.\r\n\n\r\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg\u2019s peculiarities here; how he eschewed\r\ncoffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks, done\r\nrare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the\r\npublic room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting\r\nand smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.CHAPTER VI.THE STREET\n\r\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an\r\nindividual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized\r\ntown, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll\r\nthrough the streets of New Bedford.\r\n\n\r\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer\r\nto view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even in Broadway\r\nand Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the\r\naffrighted ladies. Regent street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at\r\nBombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. But\r\nNew Bedford beats all Water street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts\r\nyou see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at\r\nstreet corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy\r\nflesh. It makes a stranger stare.\r\n\n\r\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatabooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and\r\nBrighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which\r\nunheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious,\r\ncertainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town scores of green\r\nVermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the\r\nfishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled\r\nforests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance. Many are as\r\ngreen as the Green Mountains whence they came. In some things you would think\r\nthem but a few hours old. Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He\r\nwears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and\r\nsheath-knife. Here comes another with a sou\u2019-wester and a bombazine cloak.\r\n\n\r\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one\u2014I mean a\r\ndownright bumpkin dandy\u2014a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his two\r\nacres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a country\r\ndandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation, and\r\njoins the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical things he does upon\r\nreaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to\r\nhis waistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly\r\nwill burst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven,\r\nstraps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\r\n\n\r\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and\r\nbumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer place.\r\nHad it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps have\r\nbeen in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it is, parts of her\r\nback country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony. The town itself is\r\nperhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil,\r\ntrue enough; but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets\r\ndo not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.\r\nYet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like\r\nhouses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they?\r\nhow planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?\r\n\n\r\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and\r\nyour question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens\r\ncame from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all, they were\r\nharpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander\r\nperform a feat like that?\r\n\n\r\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters,\r\nand portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You must go to New\r\nBedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil\r\nin every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti\r\ncandles.\r\n\n\r\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples\u2014long\r\navenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and\r\nbountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their\r\ntapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art; which in\r\nmany a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon\r\nthe barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation\u2019s final day.\r\n\n\r\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But roses\r\nonly bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial\r\nas sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye\r\ncannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk,\r\ntheir sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were\r\ndrawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.CHAPTER VII.THE CHAPEL\n\r\nIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman\u2019s Chapel, and few are\r\nthe moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to\r\nmake a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.\r\n\n\r\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this special\r\nerrand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist.\r\nWrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my\r\nway against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small scattered\r\ncongregation of sailors, and sailors\u2019 wives and widows. A muffled silence\r\nreigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent\r\nworshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent\r\ngrief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and\r\nthere these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several\r\nmarble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the\r\npulpit. Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not pretend to\r\nquote:\u2014\r\n\n\r\nSACRED\r\nTo the Memory\r\nof\r\nJOHN TALBOT,\r\nWho, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard,\r\nNear the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia,\nNovember 1st, 1836.\r\nTHIS TABLET\r\nIs erected to his Memory\r\nBY HIS SISTER.\r\n\n\n\r\nSACRED\r\nTo the Memory\r\nof\r\nROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY,\r\nNATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY,\r\nAND SAMUEL GLEIG,\r\nForming one of the boats\u2019 crews\r\nOF\r\nTHE SHIP ELIZA,\r\nWho were towed out of sight by a Whale,\r\nOn the Off-shore Ground in the\r\nPACIFIC,\nDecember 31st, 1839.\r\nTHIS MARBLE\r\nIs here placed by their surviving\r\nShipmates.\r\n\n\n\r\nSACRED\r\nTo the Memory\r\nof\r\nThe late\r\nCAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY,\r\nWho in the bows of his boat was killed by a\r\nSperm Whale on the coast of Japan,\nAugust 3d, 1833.\r\nTHIS TABLET\r\nIs erected to his Memory\r\nBY\r\nHIS WIDOW.\r\n\n\r\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself near\r\nthe door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me. Affected\r\nby the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous\r\ncuriosity in his countenance. This savage was the only person present who\r\nseemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read,\r\nand, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether\r\nany of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among\r\nthe congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the\r\nfishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not\r\nthe trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me\r\nwere assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak\r\ntablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.\r\n\n\r\nOh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among\r\nflowers can say\u2014here, here lies my beloved; ye know not the\r\ndesolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those\r\nblack-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in those immovable\r\ninscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that\r\nseem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the beings who have\r\nplacelessly perished without a grave. As well might those tablets stand in the\r\ncave of Elephanta as here.\r\n\n\r\nIn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why it is\r\nthat a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales, though\r\ncontaining more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is that to his name who\r\nyesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a\r\nword, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest\r\nIndies of this living earth; why the Life Insurance Companies pay\r\ndeath-forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and\r\ndeadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries\r\nago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we\r\nnevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so\r\nstrive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb\r\nwill terrify a whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.\r\n\n\r\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead\r\ndoubts she gathers her most vital hope.\r\n\n\r\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a Nantucket\r\nvoyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light of that\r\ndarkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me.\r\nYes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew merry again.\r\nDelightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it\r\nseems\u2014aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is\r\ndeath in this business of whaling\u2014a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling\r\nof a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this\r\nmatter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth\r\nis my true substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too\r\nmuch like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick\r\nwater the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.\r\nIn fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three\r\ncheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for\r\nstave my soul, Jove himself cannot.CHAPTER VIII.THE PULPIT\n\r\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness\r\nentered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a\r\nquick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested\r\nthat this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple,\r\nso called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been\r\na sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated\r\nhis life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the\r\nhardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging\r\ninto a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles,\r\nthere shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom\u2014the spring\r\nverdure peeping forth even beneath February\u2019s snow. No one having\r\npreviously heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple\r\nwithout the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\r\npeculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had\r\nled. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had\r\nnot come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet,\r\nand his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with\r\nthe weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes\r\nwere one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;\r\nwhen, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\r\n\n\r\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular\r\nstairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously\r\ncontract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had\r\nacted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs,\r\nsubstituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship\r\nfrom a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with\r\na handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\r\nnicely headed, and stained with a mahogany color, the whole contrivance,\r\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste.\r\nHalting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping\r\nthe ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and\r\nthen with a truly sailorlike but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand,\r\nmounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\r\n\n\r\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with\r\nswinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so\r\nthat at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had\r\nnot escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present\r\ninstance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after\r\ngaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit,\r\ndeliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited\r\nwithin, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.\r\n\n\r\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this. Father\r\nMapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could\r\nnot suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No,\r\nthought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must\r\nsymbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical\r\nisolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\r\nworldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\r\nword, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing\r\nstronghold\u2014a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within\r\nthe walls.\r\n\n\r\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed\r\nfrom the chaplain\u2019s former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on\r\neither hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a\r\nlarge painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off\r\na lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud\r\nand dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which\r\nbeamed forth an angel\u2019s face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot\r\nof radiance upon the ship\u2019s tossed deck, something like that silver plate\r\nnow inserted into the Victory\u2019s plank where Nelson fell. \u201cAh, noble\r\nship,\u201d the angel seemed to say, \u201cbeat on, beat on, thou noble ship,\r\nand bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are\r\nrolling off\u2014serenest azure is at hand.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had\r\nachieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the likeness of\r\na ship\u2019s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on the projecting piece of\r\nscroll work, fashioned after a ship\u2019s fiddle-headed beak.\r\n\n\r\nWhat could be more full of meaning?\u2014for the pulpit is ever this\r\nearth\u2019s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads\r\nthe world. From thence it is the storm of God\u2019s quick wrath is first\r\ndescried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the God\r\nof breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favorable winds. Yes, the\r\nworld\u2019s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the\r\npulpit is its prow.CHAPTER IX.THE SERMON\n\r\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered the\r\nscattered people to condense. \u201cStarboard gangway, there! side away to\r\nlarboard\u2014larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a still\r\nslighter shuffling of women\u2019s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every\r\neye on the preacher.\r\n\n\r\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit\u2019s bows, folded his large\r\nbrown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so\r\ndeeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\n\r\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a bell in\r\na ship that is foundering at sea in a fog\u2014in such tones he commenced\r\nreading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards the concluding\r\nstanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe ribs and terrors in the whale,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arched over me a dismal gloom,\r\nWhile all God\u2019s sun-lit waves rolled by,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And lift me deepening down to doom.\n\r\n\u201cI saw the opening maw of hell,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With endless pains and sorrows there;\r\nWhich none but they that feel can tell\u2014\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I was plunging to despair.\n\r\n\u201cIn black distress, I called my God,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I could scarce believe him mine,\r\nHe bowed his ear to my complaints\u2014\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No more the whale did me confine.\n\r\n\u201cWith speed he flew to my relief,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As on a radiant dolphin borne;\r\nAwful, yet bright, as lightning shone\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The face of my Deliverer God.\n\r\n\u201cMy song for ever shall record\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That terrible, that joyful hour;\r\nI give the glory to my God,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His all the mercy and the power.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling of\r\nthe storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of\r\nthe Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said:\r\n\u201cBeloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of\r\nJonah\u2014\u201cAnd God had prepared a great fish to swallow up\r\nJonah.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShipmates, this book, containing only four chapters\u2014four\r\nyarns\u2014is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the\r\nScriptures. Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah\u2019s deep sealine sound!\r\nwhat a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that\r\ncanticle in the fish\u2019s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We\r\nfeel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the\r\nwaters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But what is\r\nthis lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded\r\nlesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the\r\nliving God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of\r\nthe sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,\r\nrepentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all\r\nsinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful\r\ndisobedience of the command of God\u2014never mind now what that command was,\r\nor how conveyed\u2014which he found a hard command. But all the things that\r\nGod would have us do are hard for us to do\u2014remember that\u2014and hence,\r\nhe oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must\r\ndisobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness\r\nof obeying God consists.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWith this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God,\r\nby seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men, will carry him\r\ninto countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains of this earth.\r\nHe skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that\u2019s bound for\r\nTarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all\r\naccounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.\r\nThat\u2019s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz\r\nis in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed\r\nin those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because\r\nJoppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the\r\nMediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles\r\nto the westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not\r\nthen, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God? Miserable man!\r\nOh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty\r\neye, skulking from his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar\r\nhastening to cross the seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that\r\nhad there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of\r\nsomething wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly\r\nhe\u2019s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or\r\ncarpet-bag,\u2014no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. At\r\nlast, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last\r\nitems of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin,\r\nall the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the\r\nstranger\u2019s evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all\r\nease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of\r\nthe man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still\r\nserious way, one whispers to the other\u2014\u2018Jack, he\u2019s robbed a\r\nwidow;\u2019 or, \u2018Joe, do you mark him; he\u2019s a bigamist;\u2019\r\nor, \u2018Harry lad, I guess he\u2019s the adulterer that broke jail in old\r\nGomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.\u2019 Another\r\nruns to read the bill that\u2019s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to\r\nwhich the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension\r\nof a parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and looks\r\nfrom Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round\r\nJonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and\r\nsummoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.\r\nHe will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So\r\nhe makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be the man that\r\nis advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into the cabin.\r\n\n\r\n\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly\r\nmaking out his papers for the Customs\u2014\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019\r\nOh! how that harmless question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns\r\nto flee again. But he rallies. \u2018I seek a passage in this ship to\r\nTarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?\u2019 Thus far the busy captain had not\r\nlooked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he\r\nhear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. \u2018We sail\r\nwith the next coming tide,\u2019 at last he slowly answered, still intently\r\neyeing him. \u2018No sooner, sir?\u2019\u2014\u2018Soon enough for any\r\nhonest man that goes a passenger.\u2019 Ha! Jonah, that\u2019s another stab.\r\nBut he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. \u2018I\u2019ll sail\r\nwith ye,\u2019\u2014he says,\u2014\u2018the passage money, how much is\r\nthat,\u2014I\u2019ll pay now.\u2019 For it is particularly written,\r\nshipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,\r\n\u2018that he paid the fare thereof\u2019 ere the craft did sail. And taken\r\nwith the context, this is full of meaning.\r\n\n\r\nNow Jonah\u2019s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime\r\nin any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this world,\r\nshipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport;\r\nwhereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah\u2019s\r\nCaptain prepares to test the length of Jonah\u2019s purse, ere he judge him\r\nopenly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it\u2019s assented to. Then\r\nthe Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to\r\nhelp a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out\r\nhis purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to\r\nfind a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down\r\nfor his passage. \u2018Point out my state-room, Sir,\u2019 says Jonah now.\r\n\u2018I\u2019m travel-weary; I need sleep.\u2019 \u2018Thou look\u2019st\r\nlike it,\u2019 says the Captain, \u2018there\u2019s thy room.\u2019 Jonah\r\nenters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him\r\nfoolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters\r\nsomething about the doors of convicts\u2019 cells being never allowed to be\r\nlocked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his\r\nberth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead.\r\nThe air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\r\nbeneath the ship\u2019s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of\r\nthat stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his\r\nbowel\u2019s wards.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cScrewed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\r\noscillates in Jonah\u2019s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf\r\nwith the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in\r\nslight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the\r\nroom; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the\r\nfalse, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah;\r\nas lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus\r\nfar successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that\r\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and\r\nthe side, are all awry. \u2018Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!\u2019 he\r\ngroans, \u2018straight upward, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are\r\nall in crookedness!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\r\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman\r\nrace-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in\r\nthat miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for\r\nannihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he\r\nfeels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for\r\nconscience is the wound, and there\u2019s naught to staunch it; so, after sore\r\nwrestlings in his berth, Jonah\u2019s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him\r\ndrowning down to sleep.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\r\nfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides\r\nto sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the\r\ncontraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden. A\r\ndreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now when the boatswain\r\ncalls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering\r\noverboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank\r\nthunders with trampling feet right over Jonah\u2019s head; in all this raging\r\ntumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,\r\nfeels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of\r\nthe mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after\r\nhim. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship\u2014a\r\nberth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened\r\nmaster comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear, \u2018What meanest thou, O\r\nsleeper! arise!\u2019 Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah\r\nstaggers to his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out\r\nupon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping\r\nover the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no\r\nspeedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning\r\nwhile yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from\r\nthe steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing\r\nbowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\r\ntormented deep.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTerrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing\r\nattitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark him;\r\nmore and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test\r\nthe truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to casting\r\nlots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them. The lot is\r\nJonah\u2019s; that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their\r\nquestions. \u2018What is thine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country?\r\nWhat people?\u2019 But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The\r\neager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only\r\nreceive an answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question\r\nnot put by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard\r\nhand of God that is upon him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am a Hebrew,\u2019 he cries\u2014and then\u2014\u2018I fear\r\nthe Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!\u2019 Fear\r\nhim, O Jonah? Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then!\r\nStraightway, he now goes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners\r\nbecame more and more appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet\r\nsupplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his\r\ndeserts,\u2014when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him\r\nforth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was\r\nupon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the\r\nship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one hand\r\nraised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of\r\nJonah.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\r\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still,\r\nas Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He goes\r\ndown in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds\r\nthe moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the\r\nwhale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like the Lord out of the fish\u2019s\r\nbelly. But observe his prayer, and so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then\r\nJonah prayed unto learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not\r\nweep and wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is\r\njust. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that\r\nspite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple.\r\nAnd here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon,\r\nbut grateful for punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah,\r\nis shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.\r\nShipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do\r\nplace him before you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take\r\nheed to repent of it like Jonah.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm\r\nwithout seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing\r\nJonah\u2019s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest\r\nheaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at\r\nwork; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the\r\nlight leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a\r\nquick fear that was strange to them.\r\n\n\r\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of the\r\nBook once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the\r\nmoment, seemed communing with God and himself.\r\n\n\r\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with an\r\naspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon\r\nme. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah\r\nteaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a\r\ngreater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from this\r\nmast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen,\r\nwhile some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which\r\nJonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living God. How being an anointed\r\npilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those\r\nunwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the\r\nhostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty\r\nand his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never\r\nreached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him\r\ndown to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along\r\n\u2018into the midst of the seas,\u2019 where the eddying depths sucked him\r\nten thousand fathoms down, and \u2018the weeds were wrapped about his\r\nhead,\u2019 and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then\r\nbeyond the reach of any plummet\u2014\u2018out of the belly of\r\nhell\u2019\u2014when the whale grounded upon the ocean\u2019s utmost bones,\r\neven then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God\r\nspake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the\r\nwhale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights\r\nof air and earth; and \u2018vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;\u2019 when\r\nthe word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and\r\nbeaten\u2014his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of\r\nthe ocean\u2014Jonah did the Almighty\u2019s bidding. And what was that,\r\nshipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThis, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the\r\nliving God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty!\r\nWoe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into\r\na gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe to him whose\r\ngood name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in this world, courts\r\nnot dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be false were\r\nsalvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching\r\nto others is himself a castaway!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe drooped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face to\r\nthem again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly\r\nenthusiasm,\u2014\u201cBut oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe,\r\nthere is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of\r\nthe woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight\r\nis to him\u2014a far, far upward, and inward delight\u2014who against the\r\nproud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable\r\nself. Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of\r\nthis base treacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who\r\ngives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he\r\npluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges.\r\nDelight,\u2014top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord,\r\nbut the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom\r\nall the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake\r\nfrom this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be\r\nhis, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath\u2014O\r\nFather!\u2014chiefly known to me by Thy rod\u2014mortal or immortal, here I\r\ndie. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world\u2019s, or mine\r\nown. Yet this is nothing; I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he\r\nshould live out the lifetime of his God?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his\r\nhands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and he was\r\nleft alone in the place.CHAPTER X.A BOSOM FRIEND\n\r\nReturning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite\r\nalone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time. He was\r\nsitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in\r\none hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his;\r\npeering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its\r\nnose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.\r\n\n\r\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the\r\ntable, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the\r\npages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page\u2014as I\r\nfancied\u2014stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving\r\nutterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then begin\r\nagain at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each time, as though\r\nhe could not count more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of\r\nfifties being found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages\r\nwas excited.\r\n\n\r\nWith much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously\r\nmarred about the face\u2014at least to my taste\u2014his countenance yet had\r\na something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide the soul.\r\nThrough all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple\r\nhonest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed\r\ntokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils. And besides all this,\r\nthere was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness\r\ncould not altogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never\r\nhad had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his\r\nforehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive\r\nthan it otherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was\r\nhis head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it\r\nreminded me of General Washington\u2019s head, as seen in the popular busts of\r\nhim. It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the\r\nbrows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly\r\nwooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\r\n\n\r\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be looking\r\nout at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence, never troubled\r\nhimself with so much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with\r\ncounting the pages of the marvellous book. Considering how sociably we had been\r\nsleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the\r\naffectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I\r\nthought this indifference of his very strange. But savages are strange beings;\r\nat times you do not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing;\r\ntheir calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had\r\nnoticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the\r\nother seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no\r\ndesire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty\r\nsingular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.\r\nHere was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn,\r\nthat is\u2014which was the only way he could get there\u2014thrown among\r\npeople as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he\r\nseemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his\r\nown companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine\r\nphilosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.\r\nBut, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so\r\nliving or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself\r\nout for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must\r\nhave \u201cbroken his digester.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild\r\nstage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only glows to\r\nbe looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements,\r\nand peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without in\r\nsolemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in\r\nme. No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the\r\nwolfish world. This soothing savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very\r\nindifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies\r\nand bland deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to\r\nfeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would\r\nhave repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me.\r\nI\u2019ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved\r\nbut hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and\r\nhints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little noticed\r\nthese advances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night\u2019s\r\nhospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows. I\r\ntold him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little\r\ncomplimented.\r\n\n\r\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him the\r\npurpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it.\r\nThus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to jabbering the best\r\nwe could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town. Soon I\r\nproposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly\r\noffered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his,\r\nand keeping it regularly passing between us.\r\n\n\r\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan\u2019s\r\nbreast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left us\r\ncronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him;\r\nand when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me\r\nround the waist, and said that henceforth we were married; meaning, in his\r\ncountry\u2019s phrase, that we were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me,\r\nif need should be. In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have\r\nseemed far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple\r\nsavage those old rules would not apply.\r\n\n\r\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room together.\r\nHe made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous tobacco\r\nwallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver;\r\nthen spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal\r\nportions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to\r\nremonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers\u2019\r\npockets. I let them stay. He then went about his evening prayers, took out his\r\nidol, and removed the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought\r\nhe seemed anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I\r\ndeliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\r\notherwise.\r\n\n\r\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\r\nPresbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\r\nworshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you suppose\r\nnow, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth\u2014pagans and all\r\nincluded\u2014can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood?\r\nImpossible! But what is worship?\u2014to do the will of God\u2014that\r\nis worship. And what is the will of God?\u2014to do to my fellow man what I\r\nwould have my fellow man to do to me\u2014that is the will of God. Now,\r\nQueequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to\r\nme? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.\r\nConsequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So\r\nI kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little idol; offered him\r\nburnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his\r\nnose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own\r\nconsciences and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little\r\nchat.\r\n\n\r\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\r\ndisclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom\r\nof their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat over old\r\ntimes till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts\u2019 honeymoon, lay I\r\nand Queequeg\u2014a cosy, loving pair.CHAPTER XI.NIGHTGOWN\n\r\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and Queequeg\r\nnow and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and\r\nthen drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we; when,\r\nat last, by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness remained in\r\nus altogether departed, and we felt like getting up again, though day-break was\r\nyet some way down the future.\r\n\n\r\nYes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began to\r\ngrow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up; the\r\nclothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our four\r\nknees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if our\r\nknee-pans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it\r\nwas so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there\r\nwas no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily\r\nwarmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this\r\nworld that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If\r\nyou flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long\r\ntime, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg\r\nand me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly\r\nchilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most\r\ndelightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should\r\nnever be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of\r\nthe rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but\r\nthe blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then\r\nthere you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\r\n\n\r\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once I\r\nthought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by day or by\r\nnight, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes\r\nshut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed. Because no\r\nman can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if\r\ndarkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more\r\ncongenial to our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my\r\nown pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom\r\nof the unilluminated twelve-o\u2019clock-at-night, I experienced a\r\ndisagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that\r\nperhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and\r\nbesides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be\r\nit said, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the\r\nbed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love\r\nonce comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg\r\nsmoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene\r\nhousehold joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord\u2019s\r\npolicy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential\r\ncomfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend. With our\r\nshaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one\r\nto the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke,\r\nilluminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.\r\n\n\r\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far\r\ndistant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and, eager\r\nto hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied.\r\nThough at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet\r\nsubsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with his broken\r\nphraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in\r\nthe mere skeleton I give.CHAPTER XII.BIOGRAPHICAL\n\r\nQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and South. It\r\nis not down in any map; true places never are.\r\n\n\r\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass\r\nclout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green sapling; even\r\nthen, in Queequeg\u2019s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see\r\nsomething more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His father was a\r\nHigh Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he\r\nboasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors. There was excellent\r\nblood in his veins\u2014royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the\r\ncannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.\r\n\n\r\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father\u2019s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage\r\nto Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned\r\nhis suit; and not all the King his father\u2019s influence could prevail. But\r\nQueequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait,\r\nwhich he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island. On one\r\nside was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove\r\nthickets that grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among\r\nthese thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in\r\nhand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\r\nside; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed\r\nup the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a\r\nringbolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\r\n\n\r\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass over\r\nhis naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged not.\r\nStruck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit\r\nChristendom, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make himself\r\nat home. But this fine young savage\u2014this sea Prince of Wales, never saw\r\nthe captain\u2019s cabin. They put him down among the sailors, and made a\r\nwhaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of\r\nforeign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might\r\nhappily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at\r\nbottom\u2014so he told me\u2014he was actuated by a profound desire to learn\r\namong the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still happier than\r\nthey were; and more than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the\r\npractices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both\r\nmiserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father\u2019s heathens.\r\nArrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and\r\nthen going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in\r\nthat place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he,\r\nit\u2019s a wicked world in all meridians; I\u2019ll die a pagan.\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians, wore\r\ntheir clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer ways about\r\nhim, though now some time from home.\r\n\n\r\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a\r\ncoronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being very\r\nold and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and added that he\r\nwas fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending\r\nthe pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by,\r\nhe said, he would return,\u2014as soon as he felt himself baptized again. For\r\nthe nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all\r\nfour oceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in\r\nlieu of a sceptre now.\r\n\n\r\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future movements.\r\nHe answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him\r\nthat whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail out of\r\nNantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to\r\nembark from. He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard\r\nthe same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me,\r\nin short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the\r\nPotluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the\r\naffection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as\r\nsuch, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly\r\nignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as\r\nknown to merchant seamen.\r\n\n\r\nHis story being ended with his pipe\u2019s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced\r\nme, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled\r\nover from each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.CHAPTER XIII.WHEELBARROW\n\r\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a\r\nblock, I settled my own and comrade\u2019s bill; using, however, my\r\ncomrade\u2019s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed\r\namazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and\r\nQueequeg\u2014especially as Peter Coffin\u2019s cock and bull stories about\r\nhim had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now\r\ncompanied with.\r\n\n\r\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor\r\ncarpet-bag, and Queequeg\u2019s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to\r\n\u201cthe Moss,\u201d the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\r\nwharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\r\nmuch\u2014for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\r\nstreets,\u2014but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\r\nheeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and\r\nthen stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he\r\ncarried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling ships\r\ndid not find their own harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied, that though\r\nwhat I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own\r\nharpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat,\r\nand deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland\r\nreapers and mowers, who go into the farmers\u2019 meadows armed with their own\r\nscythes\u2014though in no wise obliged to furnished them\u2014even so,\r\nQueequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\r\n\n\r\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the\r\nfirst wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners of his\r\nship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his\r\nboarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing\u2014though in truth he\r\nwas entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the\r\nbarrow\u2014Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then\r\nshoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. \u201cWhy,\u201d said I,\r\n\u201cQueequeg, you might have known better than that, one would think.\r\nDidn\u2019t the people laugh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko, it\r\nseems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts\r\ninto a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms\r\nthe great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held. Now a\r\ncertain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its\r\ncommander\u2014from all accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at\r\nleast for a sea captain\u2014this commander was invited to the wedding feast\r\nof Queequeg\u2019s sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well;\r\nwhen all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride\u2019s bamboo cottage,\r\nthis Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself\r\nover against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\r\nKing, Queequeg\u2019s father. Grace being said,\u2014for those people have\r\ntheir grace as well as we\u2014though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at\r\nsuch times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the\r\nducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts\u2014Grace, I say,\r\nbeing said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the\r\nisland; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl\r\nbefore the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest,\r\nand noting the ceremony, and thinking himself\u2014being Captain of a\r\nship\u2014as having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in\r\nthe King\u2019s own house\u2014the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands\r\nin the punch bowl;\u2014taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass.\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Queequeg, \u201cwhat you tink now,\u2014Didn\u2019t\r\nour people laugh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.\r\nHoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New Bedford rose\r\nin terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear,\r\ncold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her\r\nwharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely\r\nmoored at last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with\r\nblended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new\r\ncruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\r\nbegins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever\r\nand for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly\r\neffort.\r\n\n\r\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss\r\ntossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings. How I\r\nsnuffed that Tartar air!\u2014how I spurned that turnpike earth!\u2014that\r\ncommon highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and\r\nturned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.\r\n\n\r\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His dusky\r\nnostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew,\r\nand our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived her\r\nbrows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every\r\nropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in\r\nland tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the\r\nplunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\r\nthe passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings\r\nshould be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified\r\nthan a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,\r\nby their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all\r\nverdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his\r\nback. I thought the bumpkin\u2019s hour of doom was come. Dropping his\r\nharpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous\r\ndexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly\r\ntapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon\r\nhis feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe\r\nand passed it to me for a puff.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCapting! Capting!\u201d yelled the bumpkin, running towards that\r\nofficer; \u201cCapting, Capting, here\u2019s the devil.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHallo, you sir,\u201d cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea,\r\nstalking up to Queequeg, \u201cwhat in thunder do you mean by that?\r\nDon\u2019t you know you might have killed that chap?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat him say?\u201d said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe say,\u201d said I, \u201cthat you came near kill-e that man\r\nthere,\u201d pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKill-e,\u201d cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an\r\nunearthly expression of disdain, \u201cah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg\r\nno kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook you,\u201d roared the Captain, \u201cI\u2019ll kill-e\r\nyou, you cannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so\r\nmind your eye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind his\r\nown eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet,\r\nand the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping\r\nthe entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so\r\nroughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt\r\nsnatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left,\r\nand back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on\r\nthe point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed\r\ncapable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing\r\nthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of\r\nthis consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under\r\nthe path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\r\nand then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept\r\nover his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was\r\nsafe. The schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing\r\naway the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with\r\na long living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\r\nlike a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns\r\nrevealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand\r\nand glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down.\r\nShooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg now took an\r\ninstant\u2019s glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters were,\r\ndived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm\r\nstill striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon\r\npicked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble\r\ntrump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a\r\nbarnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\r\n\n\r\nWas there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at all\r\ndeserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for\r\nwater\u2014fresh water\u2014something to wipe the brine off; that done, he\r\nput on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and\r\nmildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to\r\nhimself\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians.\r\nWe cannibals must help these Christians.\u201dCHAPTER XIV.NANTUCKET\n\r\nNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a fine\r\nrun, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\r\n\n\r\nNantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the\r\nworld it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than the\r\nEddystone lighthouse. Look at it\u2014a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all\r\nbeach, without a background. There is more sand there than you would use in\r\ntwenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some gamesome wights will tell\r\nyou that they have to plant weeds there, they don\u2019t grow naturally; that\r\nthey import Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to\r\nstop a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about\r\nlike bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before\r\ntheir houses, to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass\r\nmakes an oasis, three blades in a day\u2019s walk a prairie; that they wear\r\nquicksand shoes, something like Laplander snowshoes; that they are so shut up,\r\nbelted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by\r\nthe ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be\r\nfound adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas only\r\nshow that Nantucket is no Illinois.\r\n\n\r\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by\r\nthe red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down upon\r\nthe New England coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his talons. With\r\nloud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide\r\nwaters. They resolved to follow in the same direction. Setting out in their\r\ncanoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they\r\nfound an empty ivory casket,\u2014the poor little Indian\u2019s skeleton.\r\n\n\r\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to the\r\nsea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand; grown\r\nbolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more experienced, they pushed\r\noff in boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on\r\nthe sea, explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations\r\nround it; peeped in at Behring\u2019s Straits; and in all seasons and all\r\noceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has\r\nsurvived the flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan,\r\nsalt-sea Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that\r\nhis very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious\r\nassaults!\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from their\r\nant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so many\r\nAlexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans,\r\nas the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and\r\npile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their\r\nblazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the\r\nNantucketer\u2019s. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires;\r\nother seamen having but a right of way through it. Merchant ships are but\r\nextension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers,\r\nthough following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,\r\nother fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their\r\nliving from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and\r\nriots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and\r\nfro ploughing it as his own special plantation. There is his home;\r\nthere lies his business, which a Noah\u2019s flood would not interrupt,\r\nthough it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as\r\nprairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as\r\nchamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when\r\nhe comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the\r\nmoon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her\r\nwings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer,\r\nout of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under\r\nhis very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.CHAPTER XV.CHOWDER\n\r\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor,\r\nand Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at\r\nleast none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had\r\nrecommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to\r\nbe the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover\r\nhe had assured us that cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his\r\nchowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than\r\ntry pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping\r\na yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the\r\nlarboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner\r\nthree points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met\r\nwhere the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at\r\nfirst, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow\r\nwarehouse\u2014our first point of departure\u2014must be left on the larboard\r\nhand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.\r\nHowever, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then\r\nknocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to\r\nsomething which there was no mistaking.\r\n\n\r\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses\u2019 ears,\r\nswung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old\r\ndoorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that\r\nthis old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over\r\nsensitive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this\r\ngallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to\r\nthe two remaining horns; yes, two of them, one for Queequeg, and one for\r\nme. It\u2019s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my\r\nfirst whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen\u2019s chapel;\r\nand here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last\r\nthrowing out oblique hints touching Tophet?\r\n\n\r\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with\r\nyellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull\r\nred lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on\r\na brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGet along with ye,\u201d said she to the man, \u201cor I\u2019ll be\r\ncombing ye!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome on, Queequeg,\u201d said I, \u201call right. There\u2019s Mrs.\r\nHussey.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey\r\nentirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires\r\nfor a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the\r\npresent, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with\r\nthe relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and\r\nsaid\u2014\u201cClam or Cod?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that about Cods, ma\u2019am?\u201d said I, with much\r\npoliteness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cClam or Cod?\u201d she repeated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what you mean, Mrs.\r\nHussey?\u201d says I; \u201cbut that\u2019s a rather cold and clammy\r\nreception in the winter time, ain\u2019t it, Mrs Hussey?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt, who\r\nwas waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word\r\n\u201cclam,\u201d Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the\r\nkitchen, and bawling out \u201cclam for two,\u201d disappeared.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, \u201cdo you think that we can make out a\r\nsupper for us both on one clam?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently\r\ncheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the\r\nmystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was\r\nmade of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded\r\nship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched\r\nwith butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being\r\nsharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favorite\r\nfishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we\r\ndespatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking\r\nme of Mrs. Hussey\u2019s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a\r\nlittle experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word\r\n\u201ccod\u201d with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments\r\nthe savory steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good\r\ntime a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\r\n\n\r\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to\r\nmyself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What\u2019s that\r\nstultifying saying about chowder-headed people? \u201cBut look, Queequeg,\r\nain\u2019t that a live eel in your bowl? Where\u2019s your harpoon?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name;\r\nfor the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and\r\nchowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for\r\nfish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved\r\nwith clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and\r\nHosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was\r\na fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one\r\nmorning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen\u2019s\r\nboats, I saw Hosea\u2019s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching\r\nalong the sand with each foot in a cod\u2019s decapitated head, looking very\r\nslip-shod, I assure ye.\r\n\n\r\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\r\nconcerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up\r\nthe stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she\r\nallowed no harpoon in her chambers. \u201cWhy not?\u201d said I; \u201cevery\r\ntrue whaleman sleeps with his harpoon\u2014but why not?\u201d \u201cBecause\r\nit\u2019s dangerous,\u201d says she. \u201cEver since young Stiggs coming\r\nfrom that unfort\u2019nt v\u2019y\u2019ge of his, when he was gone four\r\nyears and a half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in my\r\nfirst floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no\r\nboarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr.\r\nQueequeg\u201d (for she had learned his name), \u201cI will just take this\r\nhere iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod\r\nto-morrow for breakfast, men?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBoth,\u201d says I; \u201cand let\u2019s have a couple of smoked\r\nherring by way of variety.\u201dCHAPTER XVI.THE SHIP\n\r\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small\r\nconcern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently\r\nconsulting Yojo\u2014the name of his black little god\u2014and Yojo had told\r\nhim two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that\r\ninstead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert\r\nselecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the\r\nselection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed\r\nbefriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel,\r\nwhich, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the\r\nworld as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must\r\nimmediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\r\n\n\r\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\r\nconfidence in the excellence of Yojo\u2019s judgment and surprising forecast\r\nof things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort\r\nof god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not\r\nsucceed in his benevolent designs.\r\n\n\r\nNow, this plan of Queequeg\u2019s, or rather Yojo\u2019s, touching the\r\nselection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little\r\nrelied on Queequeg\u2019s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to\r\ncarry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no\r\neffect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to\r\nset about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor,\r\nthat should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early,\r\nleaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom\u2014for it seemed\r\nthat it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and\r\nprayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I never could find\r\nout, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his\r\nliturgies and XXXIX Articles\u2014leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his\r\ntomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I\r\nsallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random\r\ninquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years\u2019\r\nvoyages\u2014The Devil-Dam the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. Devil-Dam, I do\r\nnot know the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod, you will no\r\ndoubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians,\r\nnow extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-Dam; from\r\nher, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and, finally, going on board the Pequod,\r\nlooked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship\r\nfor us.\r\n\n\r\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\r\nknow;\u2014squared-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\r\ngalliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old\r\ncraft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather\r\nsmall if anything; with an old fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long\r\nseasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her\r\nold hull\u2019s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier\u2019s, who\r\nhas alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her\r\nmasts\u2014cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were\r\nlost overboard in a gale\u2014her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\r\nthe three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like\r\nthe pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Beckett bled.\r\nBut to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features,\r\npertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had\r\nfollowed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded\r\nanother vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal\r\nowners of the Pequod,\u2014this old Peleg, during the term of his\r\nchief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all\r\nover, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything\r\nexcept it be Thorkill-Hake\u2019s carved buckler or bedstead. She was\r\napparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of\r\npolished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking\r\nherself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled,\r\nopen bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth\r\nof the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and\r\ntendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly\r\ntravelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend\r\nhelm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously\r\ncarved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who\r\nsteered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back\r\nhis fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most\r\nmelancholy! All noble things are touched with that.\r\n\n\r\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in\r\norder to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody;\r\nbut I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched\r\na little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in\r\nport. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long,\r\nhuge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the\r\njaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of\r\nthese slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex\r\nunited in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like a\r\ntop-knot on some old Pottowotamie Sachem\u2019s head. A triangular opening\r\nfaced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete\r\nview forward.\r\n\n\r\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his\r\naspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship\u2019s\r\nwork suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was\r\nseated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious\r\ncarving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same\r\nelastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.\r\n\n\r\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the\r\nelderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily\r\nrolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine\r\nand almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his\r\neyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales,\r\nand always looking to windward;\u2014for this causes the muscles about the\r\neyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a\r\nscowl.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs this the Captain of the Pequod?\u201d said I, advancing to the door\r\nof the tent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSupposing it be the Captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of\r\nhim?\u201d he demanded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking of shipping.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThou wast, wast thou? I see thou are no Nantucketer\u2014ever been in a\r\nstove boat?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Sir, I never have.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say\u2014eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I\u2019ve been\r\nseveral voyages in the merchant service, and I think that\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMerchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that\r\nleg?\u2014I\u2019ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest\r\nof the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye\r\nfeel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes!\r\nman, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?\u2014it looks a little\r\nsuspicious, don\u2019t it, eh?\u2014Hast not been a pirate, hast\r\nthou?\u2014Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?\u2014Dost not think of\r\nmurdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these\r\nhalf humorous inuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish\r\nNantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all\r\naliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of\r\nshipping ye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the\r\nworld.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWant to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain\r\nAhab?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho is Captain Ahab, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain\r\nhimself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThou art speaking to Captain Peleg\u2014that\u2019s who ye are\r\nspeaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod\r\nfitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We\r\nare part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know\r\nwhat whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out\r\nbefore ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab,\r\nyoung man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed\r\nup, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!\u2014ah,\r\nah!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the\r\nhearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could,\r\n\u201cWhat you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there\r\nwas any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have\r\ninferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d\u2019ye see;\r\nthou dost not talk shark a bit. Sure, ye\u2019ve been to sea before\r\nnow; sure of that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir,\u201d said I, \u201cI thought I told you that I had been four\r\nvoyages in the merchant\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant\r\nservice\u2014don\u2019t aggravate me\u2014I won\u2019t have it. But let us\r\nunderstand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye\r\nyet feel inclined for it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI do, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\r\nwhale\u2019s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be\r\ngot rid of, that is; which I don\u2019t take to be the fact.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out\r\nby experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the\r\nworld? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward\r\nthere, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me\r\nwhat ye see there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing\r\nexactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all\r\nhis crow\u2019s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.\r\n\n\r\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship\r\nswinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards\r\nthe open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and\r\nforbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s the report? said Peleg when I came back; what did ye\r\nsee?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot much,\u201d I replied\u2014\u201cnothing but water; considerable\r\nhorizon though, and there\u2019s a squall coming up, I think.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, what dost thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\r\nround Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can\u2019t ye see the world where\r\nyou stand?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod\r\nwas as good a ship as any\u2014I thought the best\u2014and all this I now\r\nrepeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to\r\nship me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\u201d he\r\nadded\u2014\u201ccome along with ye.\u201d And so saying, he led the way\r\nbelow deck into the cabin.\r\n\n\r\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising\r\nfigure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was\r\none of the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the\r\ncase in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows,\r\nfatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a\r\ntimber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in\r\nNantucket invest their money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours\r\nin approved state stocks bringing in good interest.\r\n\n\r\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the\r\nisland having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its\r\ninhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the\r\nQuaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and\r\nheterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all\r\nsailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\r\nvengeance.\r\n\n\r\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture\r\nnames\u2014a singularly common fashion on the island\u2014and in childhood\r\nnaturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom;\r\nstill, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent\r\nlives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold\r\ndashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan\r\nRoman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\r\nwith a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\r\nseclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath\r\nconstellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally\r\nand independently; receiving all nature\u2019s sweet or savage impressions\r\nfresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly,\r\nbut with some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous\r\nlofty language\u2014that man makes one in a whole nation\u2019s\r\ncensus\u2014a mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it\r\nat all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\r\ncircumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the\r\nbottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so through a\r\ncertain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is\r\nbut disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite\r\nanother; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from\r\nanother phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\r\n\n\r\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But\r\nunlike Captain Peleg\u2014who cared not a rush for what are called serious\r\nthings, and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the veriest of all\r\ntrifles\u2014Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to\r\nthe strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life,\r\nand the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn\u2014all\r\nthat had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\r\naltered one angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there\r\nsome lack of common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing,\r\nfrom conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\r\nhad illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to\r\nhuman bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns\r\nof leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious\r\nBildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did\r\nnot seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the\r\nsage and sensible conclusion that a man\u2019s religion is one thing, and this\r\npractical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\r\ncabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad\r\nshad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and\r\ncaptain, and finally a ship-owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\r\nhis adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of\r\nsixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his\r\nwell-earned income.\r\n\n\r\nNow Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old\r\nhunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in\r\nNantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the\r\nold Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried\r\nashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man,\r\nespecially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted to say the least.\r\nHe never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\r\ninordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad\r\nwas a chief-mate, to have his drab-colored eye intently looking at you, made\r\nyou feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something\u2014a hammer or\r\na marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind\r\nwhat. Indolence and idleness perished from before him. His own person was the\r\nexact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he\r\ncarried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\r\neconomical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\r\n\n\r\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed\r\nCaptain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and\r\nthere, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and\r\nthis to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs\r\nwere stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and\r\nspectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBildad,\u201d cried Captain Peleg, \u201cat it again, Bildad, eh? Ye\r\nhave been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\r\ncertain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad,\r\nwithout noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me,\r\nglanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe says he\u2019s our man, Bildad,\u201d said Peleg, \u201che wants\r\nto ship.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDost thee?\u201d said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to\r\nme.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI dost,\u201d said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do ye think of him,\u201d Bildad? said Peleg.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll do,\u201d said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling\r\naway at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\r\n\n\r\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his\r\nfriend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only\r\nlooking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the\r\nship\u2019s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a\r\nlittle table. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what\r\nterms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in\r\nthe whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain,\r\nreceived certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays\r\nwere proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective\r\nduties of the ship\u2019s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at\r\nwhaling, my own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to\r\nthe sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that\r\nfrom all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay\u2014that is,\r\nthe 275th part of the clear nett proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might\r\neventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather\r\nlong lay, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage,\r\nmight pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak\r\nof my three years\u2019 beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one\r\nstiver.\r\n\n\r\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\r\nfortune\u2014and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that\r\nnever take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is\r\nready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the\r\nThunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the\r\nfair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th,\r\nconsidering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\r\n\n\r\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving\r\na generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both\r\nCaptain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the\r\nprincipal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more\r\ninconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the\r\nship\u2019s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old\r\nBildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I\r\nnow found him on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and\r\nreading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying\r\nto mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise,\r\nconsidering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad\r\nnever heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book,\r\n\u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where\r\nmoth\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, Captain Bildad,\u201d interrupted Peleg, \u201cwhat d\u2019ye\r\nsay, what lay shall we give this young man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThou knowest best,\u201d was the sepulchral reply, \u201cthe seven\r\nhundred and seventy-seventh wouldn\u2019t be too much, would\r\nit?\u2014\u2018where moth and rust do corrupt, but\r\nlay\u2014\u2019\u201d\r\n\n\nLay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\r\nseventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall\r\nnot lay up many lays here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.\r\nIt was an exceedingly long lay that, indeed; and though from the\r\nmagnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest\r\nconsideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty\r\nlarge number, yet, when you come to make a teenth of it, you will then\r\nsee, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a\r\ngood deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I\r\nthought at the time.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, blast your eyes, Bildad,\u201d cried Peleg, \u201cthou dost not\r\nwant to swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSeven hundred and seventy-seventh,\u201d again said Bildad, without\r\nlifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling\u2014\u201cfor where your\r\ntreasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\u201d said Peleg,\r\n\u201cdo ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\r\n\u201cCaptain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\r\nduty thou owest to the other owners of this ship\u2014widows and orphans, many\r\nof them\u2014and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young\r\nman, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The seven\r\nhundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThou Bildad!\u201d roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\r\ncabin. \u201cBlast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\r\nmatters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy\r\nenough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Peleg,\u201d said Bildad steadily, \u201cthy conscience may be\r\ndrawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can\u2019t tell; but as thou\r\nart still an impenitent man, captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience\r\nbe but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery\r\npit, Captain Peleg.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\r\ninsult me. It\u2019s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\r\nhe\u2019s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and\r\nstart my soul-bolts, but I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll\u2014yes, I\u2019ll\r\nswallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye\r\ncanting, drab-colored son of a wooden gun\u2014a straight wake with ye!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous\r\noblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\r\n\n\r\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible\r\nowners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a\r\nvessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from\r\nthe door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to\r\nvanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat\r\ndown again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\r\nintention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his\r\nways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\r\nleft in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as\r\nif still nervously agitated. \u201cWhew!\u201d he whistled at\r\nlast\u2014\u201cthe squall\u2019s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou\r\nused to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife\r\nhere needs the grindstone. That\u2019s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my\r\nyoung man, Ishmael\u2019s thy name, didn\u2019t ye say? Well then, down ye go\r\nhere, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Peleg,\u201d said I, \u201cI have a friend with me who wants\r\nto ship too\u2014shall I bring him down to-morrow?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Peleg. \u201cFetch him along, and we\u2019ll\r\nlook at him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat lay does he want?\u201d groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\r\nin which he had again been burying himself.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\u201d said Peleg. \u201cHas he\r\never whaled it any?\u201d turning to me.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKilled more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, bring him along then.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done\r\na good morning\u2019s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that\r\nYojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\r\n\n\r\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the captain with\r\nwhom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a\r\nwhale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board,\r\nere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for\r\nsometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so\r\nexceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing\r\nconcernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in\r\nport, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is\r\nalways as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself\r\ninto his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain\r\nAhab was to be found.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It\u2019s all right enough;\r\nthou art shipped.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, but I should like to see him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don\u2019t\r\nknow exactly what\u2019s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\r\nhouse; a sort of sick, and yet he don\u2019t look so. In fact, he ain\u2019t\r\nsick; but no, he isn\u2019t well either. Any how, young man, he won\u2019t\r\nalways see me, so I don\u2019t suppose he will thee. He\u2019s a queer man,\r\nCaptain Ahab\u2014so some think\u2014but a good one. Oh, thou\u2019lt like\r\nhim well enough; no fear, no fear. He\u2019s a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\r\nCaptain Ahab; doesn\u2019t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may\r\nwell listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\u2019s above the common;\r\nAhab\u2019s been in colleges, as well as \u2019mong the cannibals; been used\r\nto deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger\r\nfoes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all\r\nour isle! Oh! he ain\u2019t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain\u2019t Captain\r\nPeleg; he\u2019s Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a\r\ncrowned king!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they\r\nnot lick his blood?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome hither to me\u2014hither, hither,\u201d said Peleg, with a\r\nsignificance in his eye that almost startled me. \u201cLook ye, lad; never say\r\nthat on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name\r\nhimself. \u2019Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who\r\ndied when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at\r\nGayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other\r\nfools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It\u2019s a lie. I\r\nknow Captain Ahab well; I\u2019ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know\r\nwhat he is\u2014a good man\u2014not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a\r\nswearing good man\u2014something like me\u2014only there\u2019s a good deal\r\nmore of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on\r\nthe passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the\r\nsharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one\r\nmight see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that\r\naccursed whale, he\u2019s been a kind of moody\u2014desperate moody, and\r\nsavage sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell\r\nthee and assure thee, young man, it\u2019s better to sail with a moody good\r\ncaptain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee\u2014and wrong not\r\nCaptain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has\r\na wife\u2014not three voyages wedded\u2014a sweet, resigned girl. Think of\r\nthat; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be\r\nany utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be,\r\nAhab has his humanities!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally\r\nrevealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of\r\npainfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a\r\nsorrow for him, but for I don\u2019t know what, unless it was the cruel loss\r\nof his leg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort of awe,\r\nwhich I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was.\r\nBut I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt\r\nimpatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known\r\nto me then. However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so\r\nthat for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.CHAPTER XVII.THE RAMADAN\n\r\nAs Queequeg\u2019s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all\r\nday, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I cherish the\r\ngreatest respect towards everybody\u2019s religious obligations, never mind\r\nhow comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a\r\ncongregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other creatures in\r\ncertain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented\r\nin other planets, bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor\r\nmerely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his\r\nname.\r\n\n\r\nI say, we good Presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things,\r\nand not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans and what\r\nnot, because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects. There was\r\nQueequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and\r\nhis Ramadan;\u2014but what of that? Queequeg thought he knew what he was\r\nabout, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and there let him rest. All our\r\narguing with him would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on\r\nus all\u2014Presbyterians and Pagans alike\u2014for we are all somehow\r\ndreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.\r\n\n\r\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must\r\nbe over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no answer. I tried\r\nto open it, but it was fastened inside. \u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I softly\r\nthrough the key-hole:\u2014all silent. \u201cI say, Queequeg! why don\u2019t\r\nyou speak? It\u2019s I\u2014Ishmael.\u201d But all remained still as before.\r\nI began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he\r\nmight have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the door\r\nopening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked\r\nand sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line\r\nof the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold resting against the\r\nwall the wooden shaft of Queequeg\u2019s harpoon, which the landlady the\r\nevening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber.\r\nThat\u2019s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands\r\nyonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be\r\ninside here, and no possible mistake.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQueequeg!\u2014Queequeg!\u201d\u2014all still. Something must have\r\nhappened. Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.\r\nRunning down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I\r\nmet\u2014the chambermaid. \u201cLa! La!\u201d she cried, \u201cI thought\r\nsomething must be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the\r\ndoor was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it\u2019s been just so\r\nsilent ever since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your\r\nbaggage in for safe keeping. La! La, ma\u2019am!\u2014Mistress! murder! Mrs.\r\nHussey! apoplexy!\u201d\u2014and with these cries, she ran towards the\r\nkitchen, I following.\r\n\n\r\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a vinegar-cruet\r\nin the other, having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the\r\ncastors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWood-house!\u201d cried I, \u201cwhich way to it? Run for God\u2019s\r\nsake, and fetch something to pry open the door\u2014the axe!\u2014the axe!\r\nhe\u2019s had a stroke; depend upon it!\u201d\u2014and so saying I was\r\nunmethodically rushing up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey\r\ninterposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her\r\ncountenance.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, young man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGet the axe! For God\u2019s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I\r\npry it open!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook here,\u201d said the landlady, quickly putting down the\r\nvinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; \u201clook here; are you talking\r\nabout prying open any of my doors?\u201d\u2014and with that she seized my\r\narm. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? What\u2019s the matter with you,\r\nshipmate?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the whole\r\ncase. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose, she\r\nruminated for an instant; then exclaimed\u2014\u201cNo! I haven\u2019t seen\r\nit since I put it there.\u201d Running to a little closet under the landing of\r\nthe stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that Queequeg\u2019s\r\nharpoon was missing. \u201cHe\u2019s killed himself,\u201d she cried.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfort\u2019nate stiggs done over again\u2014there goes\r\nanother counterpane\u2014god pity his poor mother!\u2014it will be the ruin\r\nof my house. Has the poor lad a sister? Where\u2019s that girl?\u2014there,\r\nBetty, go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign,\r\nwith\u2014\u2018no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the\r\nparlor;\u2019\u2014might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be\r\nmerciful to his ghost! What\u2019s that noise there? You, young man, avast\r\nthere!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open the\r\ndoor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t allow it; I won\u2019t have my premises spoiled. Go for\r\nthe locksmith, there\u2019s one about a mile from here. But avast!\u201d\r\nputting her hand in her side-pocket, \u201chere\u2019s a key that\u2019ll\r\nfit, I guess; let\u2019s see.\u201d And with that, she turned it in the lock;\r\nbut, alas! Queequeg\u2019s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave to burst it open,\u201d said I, and was running down the entry a\r\nlittle, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should\r\nnot break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush\r\ndashed myself full against the mark.\r\n\n\r\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against the\r\nwall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there sat\r\nQueequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of the room;\r\nsquatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He looked neither\r\none way nor the other way, but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of\r\nactive life.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, going up to him, \u201cQueequeg, what\u2019s\r\nthe matter with you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe hain\u2019t been a sittin\u2019 so all day, has he?\u201d said the\r\nlandlady.\r\n\n\r\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like\r\npushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable,\r\nit seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all\r\nprobability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too\r\nwithout his regular meals.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMrs. Hussey,\u201d said I, \u201che\u2019s alive at all\r\nevents; so leave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange affair\r\nmyself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to\r\ntake a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do\u2014for all my\r\npolite arts and blandishments\u2014he would not move a peg, nor say a single\r\nword, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in any the slightest way.\r\n\n\r\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do they\r\nfast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes,\r\nit\u2019s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he\u2019ll\r\nget up sooner or later, no doubt. It can\u2019t last for ever, thank God, and\r\nhis Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s very\r\npunctual then.\r\n\n\r\nI went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long stories\r\nof some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it\r\n(that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to the north\r\nof the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these\r\nplum-puddingers till nearly eleven o\u2019clock, I went up stairs to go to\r\nbed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his\r\nRamadan to a termination. But no; there he was just where I had left him; he\r\nhad not stirred an inch. I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright\r\nsenseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams\r\nin a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\r\nhave some supper. You\u2019ll starve; you\u2019ll kill yourself,\r\nQueequeg.\u201d But not a word did he reply.\r\n\n\r\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no\r\ndoubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to turning in, I\r\ntook my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a\r\nvery cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some\r\ntime, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out\r\nthe candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg\u2014not four feet\r\noff\u2014sitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and\r\ndark; this made me really wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same\r\nroom with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\r\n\n\r\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of day;\r\nwhen, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had been\r\nscrewed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the\r\nwindow, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look;\r\nlimped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again against mine; and\r\nsaid his Ramadan was over.\r\n\n\r\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person\u2019s religion, be\r\nit what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other\r\nperson, because that other person don\u2019t believe it also. But when a\r\nman\u2019s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to\r\nhim; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in;\r\nthen I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point\r\nwith him.\r\n\n\r\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg. \u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, \u201cget\r\ninto bed now, and lie and listen to me.\u201d I then went on, beginning with\r\nthe rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the\r\nvarious religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\r\nQueequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold,\r\ncheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul;\r\nopposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him,\r\ntoo, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious\r\nsavage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably\r\nfoolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes\r\nthe body cave in; hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast\r\nmust necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic\r\nreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one\r\nword, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an\r\nundigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary\r\ndyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\r\n\n\r\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia;\r\nexpressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no; only\r\nupon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his father the\r\nking, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been\r\nkilled by about two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten\r\nthat very evening.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo more, Queequeg,\u201d said I, shuddering; \u201cthat will\r\ndo;\u201d for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them. I had\r\nseen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\r\ncustom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in\r\nthe yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in\r\ngreat wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and\r\ncocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the\r\nvictor\u2019s compliments to all his friends, just as though these presents\r\nwere so many Christmas turkeys.\r\n\n\r\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression\r\nupon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing\r\non that important subject, unless considered from his own point of view; and,\r\nin the second place, he did not more than one third understand me, couch my\r\nideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal\r\nmore about the true religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of\r\ncondescending concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that\r\nsuch a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\r\npiety.\r\n\n\r\nAt last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\r\nbreakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make much\r\nprofit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, sauntering\r\nalong, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.CHAPTER XVIII.HIS MARK\n\r\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg\r\ncarrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from\r\nhis wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and\r\nfurthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless\r\nthey previously produced their papers.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?\u201d said I, now jumping on\r\nthe bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI mean,\u201d he replied, \u201che must show his papers.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYea,\u201d said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head\r\nfrom behind Peleg\u2019s, out of the wigwam. \u201cHe must show that\r\nhe\u2019s converted. Son of darkness,\u201d he added, turning to Queequeg,\r\n\u201cart thou at present in communion with any christian church?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said I, \u201che\u2019s a member of the first\r\nCongregational Church.\u201d Here be it said, that many tattooed savages\r\nsailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFirst Congregational Church,\u201d cried Bildad, \u201cwhat! that\r\nworships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman\u2019s meeting-house?\u201d and so\r\nsaying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana\r\nhandkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and\r\nleaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow long hath he been a member?\u201d he then said, turning to me;\r\n\u201cnot very long, I rather guess, young man.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Peleg, \u201cand he hasn\u2019t been baptized right\r\neither, or it would have washed some of that devil\u2019s blue off his\r\nface.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo tell, now,\u201d cried Bildad, \u201cis this Philistine a regular\r\nmember of Deacon Deuteronomy\u2019s meeting? I never saw him going there, and\r\nI pass it every Lord\u2019s day.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his\r\nmeeting,\u201d said I, \u201call I know is, that Queequeg here is a born\r\nmember of the First Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg\r\nis.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d said Bildad sternly, \u201cthou art skylarking with\r\nme\u2014explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean?\r\nanswer me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. \u201cI mean, sir, the same\r\nancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and\r\nQueequeg here, and all of us, and every mother\u2019s son and soul of us\r\nbelong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping\r\nworld; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets\r\nnoways touching the grand belief; in that we all join hands.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSplice, thou mean\u2019st splice hands, cried Peleg, drawing\r\nnearer. \u201cYoung man, you\u2019d better ship for a missionary, instead of\r\na fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy\u2014why\r\nFather Mapple himself couldn\u2019t beat it, and he\u2019s reckoned\r\nsomething. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell\r\nQuohog there\u2014what\u2019s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along.\r\nBy the great anchor, what a harpoon he\u2019s got there! looks like good stuff\r\nthat; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is,\r\ndid you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a\r\nfish?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the\r\nbulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the\r\nside; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in\r\nsome such way as this:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCap\u2019ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him?\r\nwell, spose him one whale eye, well, den!\u201d and taking sharp aim at it, he\r\ndarted the iron right over old Bildad\u2019s broad brim, clean across the\r\nship\u2019s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, \u201cspos-ee\r\nhim whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuick, Bildad,\u201d said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\r\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.\r\n\u201cQuick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship\u2019s papers. We must have\r\nHedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog,\r\nwe\u2019ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that\u2019s more than ever was\r\ngiven a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled\r\namong the same ship\u2019s company to which I myself belonged.\r\n\n\r\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\r\nsigning, he turned to me and said, \u201cI guess Quohog there don\u2019t know\r\nhow to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or make\r\nthy mark?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in\r\nsimilar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen, copied\r\nupon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round\r\nfigure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg\u2019s\r\nobstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like\r\nthis:\u2014\r\n\n\r\nQuohog.\r\nhis mark.\r\n\n\n\n\n\r\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at\r\nlast rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab\r\ncoat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled \u201cThe Latter\r\nDay Coming; or No Time to Lose,\u201d placed it in Queequeg\u2019s hands, and\r\nthen grasping them and the book with both his, looked earnestly into his eyes,\r\nand said, \u201cSon of darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part owner of\r\nthis ship, and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou still\r\nclingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for\r\naye a Belial bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from\r\nthe wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of\r\nthe fiery pit!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad\u2019s language,\r\nheterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAvast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our\r\nharpooneer,\u201d cried Peleg. \u201cPious harpooneers never make good\r\nvoyagers\u2014it takes the shark out of \u2019em; no harpooneer is worth a\r\nstraw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest\r\nboat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and\r\nnever came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he\r\nshrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps in case he got\r\nstove and went to Davy Jones.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPeleg! Peleg!\u201d said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands,\r\n\u201cthou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,\r\nPeleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can\u2019st thou prate\r\nin this ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this\r\nsame Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that\r\nsame voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did\u2019st thou not think\r\nof Death and the Judgment then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHear him, hear him now,\u201d cried Peleg, marching across the cabin,\r\nand thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,\u2014\u201chear him, all\r\nof ye. Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death\r\nand the judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting\r\nthundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft.\r\nThink of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death then.\r\nLife was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save all\r\nhands\u2014how to rig jury-masts\u2014how to get into the nearest port; that\r\nwas what I was thinking of.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we\r\nfollowed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sail-makers who\r\nwere mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a\r\npatch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted.CHAPTER XIX.THE PROPHET\n\r\n\u201cShipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the\r\nwater, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above words\r\nwere put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his massive\r\nforefinger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily apparelled in faded\r\njacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck.\r\nA confluent small-pox had in all directions flowed over his face, and left it\r\nlike the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been\r\ndried up.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHave ye shipped in her?\u201d he repeated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,\u201d said I, trying to gain a\r\nlittle more time for an uninterrupted look at him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, the Pequod\u2014that ship there,\u201d he said, drawing back his\r\nwhole arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed\r\nbayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said I, \u201cwe have just signed the articles.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnything down there about your souls?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, perhaps you hav\u2019n\u2019t got any,\u201d he said quickly.\r\n\u201cNo matter though, I know many chaps that hav\u2019n\u2019t got\r\nany,\u2014good luck to \u2019em; and they are all the better off for it. A\r\nsoul\u2019s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you jabbering about, shipmate?\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of\r\nthat sort in other chaps,\u201d abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous\r\nemphasis upon the word he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, \u201clet\u2019s go; this fellow has broken\r\nloose from somewhere; he\u2019s talking about something and somebody we\r\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d cried the stranger. \u201cYe said true\u2014ye\r\nhav\u2019n\u2019t seen Old Thunder yet, have ye?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s Old Thunder?\u201d said I, again riveted with the insane\r\nearnestness of his manner.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Ahab.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye\r\nhav\u2019n\u2019t seen him yet, have ye?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, we hav\u2019n\u2019t. He\u2019s sick they say, but is getting\r\nbetter, and will be all right again before long.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll right again before long!\u201d laughed the stranger, with a\r\nsolemnly derisive sort of laugh. \u201cLook ye; when captain Ahab is all\r\nright, then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you know about him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat did they tell you about him? Say that!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell much of anything about him; only I\u2019ve heard\r\nthat he\u2019s a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, that\u2019s true\u2014yes, both true enough. But\r\nyou must jump when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and\r\ngo\u2014that\u2019s the word with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing\r\nthat happened to him off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three\r\ndays and nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore\r\nthe altar in Santa?\u2014heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the\r\nsilver calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,\r\naccording to the prophecy. Didn\u2019t ye hear a word about them matters and\r\nsomething more, eh? No, I don\u2019t think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it?\r\nNot all Nantucket, I guess. But hows\u2019ever, mayhap, ye\u2019ve heard tell\r\nabout the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh\r\nyes, that every one knows a\u2019most\u2014I mean they know he\u2019s\r\nonly one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d said I, \u201cwhat all this gibberish of yours is\r\nabout, I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t much care; for it seems to me that\r\nyou must be a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain\r\nAhab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all\r\nabout the loss of his leg.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll about it, eh\u2014sure you do?\u2014all?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPretty sure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger\r\nstood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little, turned and\r\nsaid:\u2014\u201cYe\u2019ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the papers?\r\nWell, well, what\u2019s signed, is signed; and what\u2019s to be, will be;\r\nand then again, perhaps it wont be, after all. Any how, it\u2019s all fixed\r\nand arranged a\u2019ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I\r\nsuppose; as well these as any other men, God pity \u2019em! Morning to ye,\r\nshipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I\u2019m sorry I stopped\r\nye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook here, friend,\u201d said I, \u201cif you have anything important\r\nto tell us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are\r\nmistaken in your game; that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that\r\nway; you are just the man for him\u2014the likes of ye. Morning to ye,\r\nshipmates, morning! Oh, when ye get there, tell \u2019em I\u2019ve concluded\r\nnot to make one of \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh, my dear fellow, you can\u2019t fool us that way\u2014you\r\ncan\u2019t fool us. It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as\r\nif he had a great secret in him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMorning to ye, shipmates, morning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMorning it is,\u201d said I. \u201cCome along, Queequeg, let\u2019s\r\nleave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cElijah.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nElijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each\r\nother\u2019s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was\r\nnothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above\r\na hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did so,\r\nwho should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance. Somehow, the\r\nsight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind,\r\nbut passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn\r\nthe same corner that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was\r\ndogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This\r\ncircumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,\r\nshrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and\r\nhalf-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and\r\nthe leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what\r\nCaptain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the\r\nprediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail;\r\nand a hundred other shadowy things.\r\n\n\r\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging\r\nus or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side\r\nof it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us.\r\nThis relieved me; and once more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced\r\nhim in my heart, a humbug.CHAPTER XX.ALL ASTIR\n\r\nA day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not only\r\nwere the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board, and bolts\r\nof canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened that the\r\nship\u2019s preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or\r\nnever went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the\r\nhands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men\r\nemployed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after\r\nnight-fall.\r\n\n\r\nOn the day following Queequeg\u2019s signing the articles, word was given at\r\nall the inns where the ship\u2019s company were stopping, that their chests\r\nmust be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the vessel\r\nmight be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to\r\nsleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always give very long notice in\r\nthese cases, and the ship did not sail for several days. But no wonder; there\r\nwas a good deal to be done, and there is no telling how many things to be\r\nthought of, before the Pequod was fully equipped.\r\n\n\r\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things\u2014beds, sauce-pans, knives and\r\nforks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are\r\nindispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which\r\nnecessitates a three-years\u2019 housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from\r\nall grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also\r\nholds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with\r\nwhalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous\r\narticles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of\r\nreplacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered,\r\nthat of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all\r\nkinds, and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which\r\nthe success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars,\r\nand spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare\r\ncaptain and duplicate ship.\r\n\n\r\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the Pequod\r\nhad been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel, and iron\r\nhoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was a continual\r\nfetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things, both large\r\nand small.\r\n\n\r\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad\u2019s\r\nsister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but\r\nwithal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she could help it,\r\nnothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to\r\nsea. At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the\r\nsteward\u2019s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief\r\nmate\u2019s desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel\r\nfor the small of some one\u2019s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better\r\ndeserve her name, which was Charity\u2014Aunt Charity, as everybody called\r\nher. And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about\r\nhither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised\r\nto yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in which her\r\nbeloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or\r\ntwo of well-saved dollars.\r\n\n\r\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board,\r\nas she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer\r\nwhaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all\r\nbackward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a long list of the articles\r\nneeded, and at every fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that article\r\nupon the paper. Every once and a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone\r\nden, roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the\r\nmast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\r\n\n\r\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and\r\nas often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was going to\r\ncome on board his ship. To these questions they would answer, that he was\r\ngetting better and better, and was expected aboard every day; meantime, the two\r\nCaptains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the\r\nvessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I would have\r\nseen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this\r\nway to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be\r\nthe absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea.\r\nBut when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already\r\ninvolved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even\r\nfrom himself. And much this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to\r\nthink nothing.\r\n\n\r\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail.\r\nSo next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.CHAPTER XXI.GOING ABOARD\n\r\nIt was nearly six o\u2019clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we\r\ndrew nigh the wharf.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,\u201d said\r\nI to Queequeg, \u201cit can\u2019t be shadows; she\u2019s off by sunrise, I\r\nguess; come on!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAvast!\u201d cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close\r\nbehind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself\r\nbetween us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight,\r\nstrangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGoing aboard?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHands off, will you,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLookee here,\u201d said Queequeg, shaking himself, \u201cgo\r\n\u2019way!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAint going aboard, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, we are,\u201d said I, \u201cbut what business is that of yours?\r\nDo you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, no; I wasn\u2019t aware of that,\u201d said Elijah, slowly and\r\nwonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cElijah,\u201d said I, \u201cyou will oblige my friend and me by\r\nwithdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer\r\nnot to be detained.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYe be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s cracked, Queequeg,\u201d said I, \u201ccome on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHolloa!\u201d cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a\r\nfew paces.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever mind him,\u201d said I, \u201cQueequeg, come on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder,\r\nsaid\u2014\u201cDid ye see anything looking like men going towards that ship\r\na while ago?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStruck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, \u201cYes, I\r\nthought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery dim, very dim,\u201d said Elijah. \u201cMorning to ye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOnce more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and touching\r\nmy shoulder again, said, \u201cSee if you can find \u2019em now, will\r\nye?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFind who?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMorning to ye! morning to ye!\u201d he rejoined, again moving off.\r\n\u201cOh! I was going to warn ye against\u2014but never mind, never\r\nmind\u2014it\u2019s all one, all in the family too;\u2014sharp frost this\r\nmorning, ain\u2019t it? Good bye to ye. Shan\u2019t see ye again very soon, I\r\nguess; unless it\u2019s before the Grand Jury.\u201d And with these cracked\r\nwords he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment\r\nat his frantic impudence.\r\n\n\r\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound quiet,\r\nnot a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the hatches were all\r\non, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to the forecastle, we\r\nfound the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we went down, and found\r\nonly an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at\r\nwhole length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded\r\narms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThose sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\u201d said\r\nI, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,\r\nQueequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have\r\nthought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for\r\nElijah\u2019s otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the thing down; and\r\nagain marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had\r\nbest sit up with the body; telling him to establish himself accordingly. He put\r\nhis hand upon the sleeper\u2019s rear, as though feeling if it was soft\r\nenough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGracious! Queequeg, don\u2019t sit there,\u201d said I.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! perry dood seat,\u201d said Queequeg, \u201cmy country way;\r\nwon\u2019t hurt him face.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFace!\u201d said I, \u201ccall that his face? very benevolent\r\ncountenance then; but how hard he breathes, he\u2019s heaving himself; get\r\noff, Queequeg, you are heavy, it\u2019s grinding the face of the poor. Get\r\noff, Queequeg! Look, he\u2019ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don\u2019t\r\nwake.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and lighted\r\nhis tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing over the\r\nsleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him in his broken\r\nfashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land, owing to the absence\r\nof settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people\r\ngenerally, were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for\r\nottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to\r\nbuy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves.\r\nBesides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much better than those\r\ngarden-chairs which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief\r\ncalling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a\r\nspreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.\r\n\n\r\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from\r\nme, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper\u2019s head.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that for, Queequeg?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPerry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe, which, it\r\nseemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul, when we\r\nwere directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The strong vapor now completely\r\nfilling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort\r\nof muffledness; then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or\r\ntwice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHolloa!\u201d he breathed at last, \u201cwho be ye smokers?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShipped men,\u201d answered I, \u201cwhen does she sail?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain came\r\naboard last night.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat Captain?\u2014Ahab?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho but him indeed?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we heard a\r\nnoise on deck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHolloa! Starbuck\u2019s astir,\u201d said the rigger.\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lively chief mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all\r\nalive now, I must turn to.\u201d And so saying he went on deck, and we\r\nfollowed.\r\n\n\r\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes; the\r\nriggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged; and several of\r\nthe shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board. Meanwhile\r\nCaptain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin.CHAPTER XXII.MERRY CHRISTMAS\n\r\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship\u2019s riggers,\r\nand after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the\r\never-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whaleboat, with her last gift\u2014a\r\nnight-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare bible for\r\nthe steward\u2014after all this, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued\r\nfrom the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all\r\nready\u2014just spoke to him\u2014nothing more to be got from shore, eh?\r\nWell, call all hands, then. Muster \u2019em aft here\u2014blast\r\n\u2019em!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,\u201d said\r\nBildad, \u201cbut away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHow now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain Peleg and\r\nCaptain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as if\r\nthey were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port.\r\nAnd, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he\r\nwas in the cabin. But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means\r\nnecessary in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.\r\nIndeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot\u2019s; and\r\nas he was not yet completely recovered\u2014so they said\u2014therefore,\r\nCaptain Ahab stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in\r\nthe merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\r\nconsiderable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table,\r\nhaving a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends, before they quit the\r\nship for good with the pilot.\r\n\n\r\nBut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg was\r\nnow all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and not\r\nBildad.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAft here, ye sons of bachelors,\u201d he cried, as the sailors lingered\r\nat the main-mast. \u201cMr. Starbuck, drive \u2019em aft.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStrike the tent there!\u201d\u2014was the next order. As I hinted\r\nbefore, this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board\r\nthe Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to be\r\nthe next thing to heaving up the anchor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMan the capstan! Blood and thunder!\u2014jump!\u201d\u2014was the\r\nnext command, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.\r\n\n\r\nNow, in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is the\r\nforward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in\r\naddition to his other offices, was one of the licensed pilots of the\r\nport\u2014he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save\r\nthe Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never\r\npiloted any other craft\u2014Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged\r\nin looking over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing\r\nwhat seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who\r\nroared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty\r\ngood will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no\r\nprofane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in getting\r\nunder weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts\r\nin each seaman\u2019s berth.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and swore\r\nastern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink the ship\r\nbefore the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my handspike, and\r\ntold Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting\r\non the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself, however,\r\nwith the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of\r\nhis seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in\r\nmy rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in\r\nthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first\r\nkick.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs that the way they heave in the marchant service?\u201d he roared.\r\n\u201cSpring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! why don\u2019t\r\nye spring, I say, all of ye\u2014spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the\r\nred whiskers; spring there, Scotchcap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I say,\r\nall of ye, and spring your eyes out!\u201d And so saying, he moved along the\r\nwindlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad\r\nkept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been\r\ndrinking something to-day.\r\n\n\r\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a\r\nshort, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we\r\nfound ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray cased\r\nus in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks\r\nglistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge\r\nelephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.\r\n\n\r\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the old\r\ncraft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all over\r\nher, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were\r\nheard,\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSweet fields beyond the swelling flood,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stand dressed in living green.\r\nSo to the Jews old Canaan stood,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Jordan rolled between.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They were full\r\nof hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous\r\nAtlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was yet, it then seemed\r\nto me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and glades so eternally\r\nvernal, that the grass shot up by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at\r\nmidsummer.\r\n\n\r\nAt last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no longer.\r\nThe stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside.\r\n\n\r\nIt was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this\r\njuncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very loath to\r\nleave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage\u2014beyond\r\nboth stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars\r\nwere invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost\r\nas old as he, once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless\r\njaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to\r\nhim,\u2014poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides;\r\nran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on\r\ndeck, and looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only\r\nbounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the land,\r\nlooked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at\r\nlast, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout\r\nPeleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing\r\nheroically in his face, as much as to say, \u201cNevertheless, friend Peleg, I\r\ncan stand it; yes, I can.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his\r\nphilosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern came too\r\nnear. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck\u2014now a word\r\nbelow, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.\r\n\n\r\nBut, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about\r\nhim,\u2014\u201cCaptain Bildad\u2014come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the\r\nmain-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful,\r\ncareful!\u2014come, Bildad, boy\u2014say your last. Luck to ye,\r\nStarbuck\u2014luck to ye, Mr. Stubb\u2014luck to ye, Mr.\r\nFlask\u2014good-bye, and good luck to ye all\u2014and this day three years\r\nI\u2019ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and\r\naway!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,\u201d murmured old\r\nBildad, almost incoherently. \u201cI hope ye\u2019ll have fine weather now,\r\nso that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye\u2014a pleasant sun is all he\r\nneeds, and ye\u2019ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be\r\ncareful in the hunt, ye mates. Don\u2019t stave the boats needlessly, ye\r\nharpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent. within the\r\nyear. Don\u2019t forget your prayers, either. Mr Starbuck, mind that cooper\r\ndon\u2019t waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in the green\r\nlocker! Don\u2019t whale it too much a\u2019 Lord\u2019s days, men; but\r\ndon\u2019t miss a fair chance either, that\u2019s rejecting Heaven\u2019s\r\ngood gifts. Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little\r\nleaky, I thought. If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication.\r\nGood-bye, good-bye! Don\u2019t keep that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr.\r\nStarbuck; it\u2019ll spoil. Be careful with the butter\u2014twenty cents the\r\npound it was, and mind ye, if\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,\u2014away!\u201d and with\r\nthat, Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.\r\n\n\r\nShip and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a screaming\r\ngull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three heavy-hearted\r\ncheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic.CHAPTER XXIII.THE LEE SHORE\n\r\nSome chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, new-landed mariner,\r\nencountered in New Bedford at the inn.\r\n\n\r\nWhen on that shivering winter\u2019s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive\r\nbows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her helm but\r\nBulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in\r\nmid-winter just landed from a four years\u2019 dangerous voyage, could so\r\nunrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term. The land seemed\r\nscorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep\r\nmemories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of\r\nBulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed\r\nship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give\r\nsuccor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone,\r\nsupper, warm blankets, friends, all that\u2019s kind to our mortalities. But\r\nin that gale, the port, the land, is that ship\u2019s direst jeopardy; she\r\nmust fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel,\r\nwould make her shudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all\r\nsail off shore; in so doing, fights \u2019gainst the very winds that fain\r\nwould blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea\u2019s landlessness again;\r\nfor refuge\u2019s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her\r\nbitterest foe!\r\n\n\r\nKnow ye, now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally\r\nintolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort\r\nof the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds\r\nof heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?\r\n\n\r\nBut as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite\r\nas God\u2014so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be\r\ningloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For worm-like,\r\nthen, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this\r\nagony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod!\r\nUp from the spray of thy ocean-perishing\u2014straight up, leaps thy\r\napotheosis!CHAPTER XXIV.THE ADVOCATE\n\r\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling; and as\r\nthis business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a\r\nrather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to\r\nconvince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales.\r\n\n\r\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact,\r\nthat among people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted on a level\r\nwith what are called the liberal professions. If a stranger were introduced\r\ninto any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but slightly advance the\r\ngeneral opinion of his merits, were he presented to the company as a\r\nharpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the\r\ninitials S. W. F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure\r\nwould be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.\r\n\n\r\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen, is\r\nthis: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of\r\nbusiness; and that when actively engaged therein, we are surrounded by all\r\nmanner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and\r\nbutchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world\r\ninvariably delights to honor. And as for the matter of the alleged\r\nuncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts\r\nhitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly\r\nplant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy\r\nearth. But even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered\r\nslippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of\r\nthose battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all\r\nladies\u2019 plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular\r\nconceit of the soldier\u2019s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran\r\nwho has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition\r\nof the sperm whale\u2019s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his\r\nhead. For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the\r\ninterlinked terrors and wonders of God!\r\n\n\r\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay\r\nus the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost all the\r\ntapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as before so many\r\nshrines, to our glory!\r\n\n\r\nBut look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales; see\r\nwhat we whalemen are, and have been.\r\n\n\r\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt\u2019s time have admirals of their whaling\r\nfleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit out\r\nwhaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two\r\nof families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did Britain between the years\r\n1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of \u00a31,000,000? And\r\nlastly, how comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of\r\nthe banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred\r\nvessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of\r\ndollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000; and every year\r\nimporting into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all\r\nthis, if there be not something puissant in whaling?\r\n\n\r\nBut this is not the half; look again.\r\n\n\r\nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life, point\r\nout one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years has\r\noperated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate,\r\nthan the high and mighty business of whaling. One way and another, it has\r\nbegotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in\r\ntheir sequential issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian\r\nmother, who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb. It would be a\r\nhopeless, endless task to catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice.\r\nFor many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the\r\nremotest and least known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and\r\narchipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed.\r\nIf American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors,\r\nlet them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship, which\r\noriginally showed them the way, and first interpreted between them and the\r\nsavages. They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions,\r\nyour Cookes, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains\r\nhave sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater than your Cooke\r\nand your Krusenstern. For in their succorless emptyhandedness, they, in the\r\nheathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,\r\nbattled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cooke with all his marines and\r\nmuskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such a flourish of in\r\nthe old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the lifetime commonplaces of\r\nour heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver dedicates three\r\nchapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ship\u2019s\r\ncommon log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!\r\n\n\r\nUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial, scarcely\r\nany intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and the long line\r\nof the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It was the whaleman who\r\nfirst broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown, touching those\r\ncolonies; and, if space permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those\r\nwhalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the\r\nyoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those\r\nparts.\r\n\n\r\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the\r\nenlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born discovery by a\r\nDutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous;\r\nbut the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now\r\nmighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the\r\nemigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of\r\nthe whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles\r\nof all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the\r\nwhale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in\r\nmany cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If\r\nthat double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the\r\nwhale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\n\r\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no\r\n\u00e6sthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to shiver\r\nfifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time.\r\n\n\r\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will say.\r\n\n\nThe whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler? Who wrote\r\nthe first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who composed the\r\nfirst narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than Alfred the\r\nGreat, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from Other, the\r\nNorwegian whale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in\r\nParliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!\r\n\n\r\nTrue enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no good\r\nblood in their veins.\r\n\n\nNo good blood in their veins? They have something better than royal\r\nblood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards,\r\nby marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the\r\nancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers\u2014all kith and kin to\r\nnoble Benjamin\u2014this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the\r\nworld to the other.\r\n\n\r\nGood again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.\r\n\n\nWhaling not respectable? Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory\r\nlaw, the whale is declared a royal fish.*\n\n\r\nOh, that\u2019s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any grand\r\nimposing way.\r\n\n\nThe whale never figured in any grand imposing way? In one of the mighty\r\ntriumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world\u2019s capital,\r\nthe bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the most\r\nconspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*\n\n\r\nGrant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real dignity\r\nin whaling.\r\n\n\nNo dignity in whaling? The dignity of our calling the very heavens\r\nattest. Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your hat in\r\npresence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I know a man that,\r\nin his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales. I account that man\r\nmore honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as\r\nmany walled towns.\r\n\n\r\nAnd, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered prime\r\nthing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high\r\nhushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if hereafter I\r\nshall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather have done than to\r\nhave left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or more properly my creditors,\r\nfind any precious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the\r\nhonor and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my\r\nHarvard.\r\n\n\n *\n \r\nSee subsequent chapters for something more on this head.CHAPTER XXV.POSTSCRIPT\n\r\nIn behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but\r\nsubstantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who should\r\nwholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell eloquently upon\r\nhis cause\u2014such an advocate, would he not be blameworthy?\r\n\n\r\nIt is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones,\r\na certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone\r\nthrough. There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be a caster\r\nof state. How they use the salt, precisely\u2014who knows? Certain I am,\r\nhowever, that a king\u2019s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as\r\na head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making\r\nits interior run well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here,\r\nconcerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in common life\r\nwe esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and\r\npalpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil,\r\nunless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere.\r\nAs a general rule, he can\u2019t amount to much in his totality.\r\n\n\r\nBut the only thing to be considered here, is this\u2014what kind of oil is\r\nused at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor\r\ncastor oil, nor bear\u2019s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What then\r\ncan it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the\r\nsweetest of all oils?\r\n\n\r\nThink of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens with\r\ncoronation stuff!CHAPTER XXVI.KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES\n\r\nThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker\r\nby descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed\r\nwell adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked\r\nbiscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled\r\nale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon\r\none of those fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid\r\nsummers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical\r\nsuperfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token\r\nof wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily\r\nblight. It was merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means\r\nill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\r\nclosely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a\r\nrevivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to\r\ncome, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a\r\npatent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all\r\nclimates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering\r\nimages of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A\r\nstaid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of\r\naction, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and\r\nfortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in\r\nsome cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\r\nconscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild\r\nwatery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to\r\nsuperstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some organizations\r\nseems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward\r\nportents and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent\r\nthe welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories of\r\nhis young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the original\r\nruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent influences\r\nwhich, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so\r\noften evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery.\r\n\u201cI will have no man in my boat,\u201d said Starbuck, \u201cwho is not\r\nafraid of a whale.\u201d By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most\r\nreliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of\r\nthe encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous\r\ncomrade than a coward.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye,\u201d said Stubb, the second mate, \u201cStarbuck, there, is\r\nas careful a man as you\u2019ll find anywhere in this fishery.\u201d But we\r\nshall ere long see what that word \u201ccareful\u201d precisely means when\r\nused by a man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\r\n\n\r\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment; but\r\na thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally practical\r\noccasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling,\r\ncourage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like her beef and her\r\nbread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering\r\nfor whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\r\npersisted in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\r\nocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs;\r\nand that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was\r\nhis own father\u2019s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn\r\nlimbs of his brother?\r\n\n\r\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\r\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which could,\r\nnevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not in\r\nreasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences\r\nand remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that these things should fail\r\nin latently engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,\r\nwould break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as\r\nhe might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men,\r\nwhich, while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\r\nwhales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot\r\nwithstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes\r\nmenace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.\r\n\n\r\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal, in any instance, the complete\r\nabasement of poor Starbuck\u2019s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to\r\nwrite it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of\r\nvalor in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and\r\nnations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be; men may have mean and\r\nmeagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand\r\nand glowing creature, that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows\r\nshould run to throw their costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel\r\nwithin ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer\r\ncharacter seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a\r\nvalor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely\r\nstifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I\r\ntreat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity\r\nwhich has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that\r\nwields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands,\r\nradiates without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and\r\ncircumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!\r\n\n\r\nIf, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall hereafter\r\nascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic graces; if even\r\nthe most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them all, shall at times\r\nlift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch that workman\u2019s arm\r\nwith some ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set\r\nof sun; then against all mortal critics bear me out in it, thou just spirit of\r\nequality, which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear\r\nme out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart\r\nconvict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly\r\nhammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes;\r\nThou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon\r\na war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all Thy\r\nmighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly\r\ncommons; bear me out in it, O God!CHAPTER XXVII.KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES\n\r\nStubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence, according to\r\nlocal usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor\r\nvaliant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air; and while engaged\r\nin the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a\r\njourneyman joiner engaged for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he\r\npresided over his whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner,\r\nand his crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\r\narrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the\r\nsnugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the\r\nfight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling\r\ntinker his hammer. He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and\r\nflank with the most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb,\r\nconverted the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death\r\nitself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a\r\nquestion; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\r\ncomfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of\r\ncall of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something\r\nwhich he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.\r\n\n\r\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easygoing, unfearing man,\r\nso cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave\r\npeddlers, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to bring about\r\nthat almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have been his pipe. For,\r\nlike his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of\r\nhis face. You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk\r\nwithout his nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\r\nloaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned\r\nin, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from the other to the\r\nend of the chapter; then loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when\r\nStubb dressed, instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his\r\npipe into his mouth.\r\n\n\r\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\r\npeculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether ashore\r\nor afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless\r\nmortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the cholera, some people\r\ngo about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against\r\nall mortal tribulations, Stubb\u2019s tobacco smoke might have operated as a\r\nsort of disinfecting agent.\r\n\n\r\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. A\r\nshort, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who\r\nsomehow seemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally and\r\nhereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with\r\nhim, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to all sense\r\nof reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and\r\nso dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from\r\nencountering them; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a\r\nspecies of magnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring only a little\r\ncircumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill\r\nand boil. This ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little\r\nwaggish in the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and\r\na three years\u2019 voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\r\nthat length of time. As a carpenter\u2019s nails are divided into wrought\r\nnails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask was one\r\nof the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They called him\r\nKing-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could be well likened to\r\nthe short, square timber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by the\r\nmeans of many radiating side timbers inserted in it, served to brace the ship\r\nagainst the icy concussions of those battering seas.\r\n\n\r\nNow these three mates\u2014Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.\r\nThey it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod\u2019s\r\nboats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would\r\nprobably marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three headsmen were\r\nas captains of companies. Or, being armed with their long keen whaling spears,\r\nthey were as a picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of\r\njavelins.\r\n\n\r\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic Knight\r\nof old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer, who in certain\r\nconjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the former one has been\r\nbadly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and moreover, as there generally\r\nsubsists between the two, a close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore\r\nbut meet, that in this place we set down who the Pequod\u2019s harpooneers\r\nwere, and to what headsman each of them belonged.\r\n\n\r\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for his\r\nsquire. But Queequeg is already known.\r\n\n\r\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\r\npromontory of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where there still exists the last\r\nremnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island\r\nof Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they\r\nusually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego\u2019s long, lean,\r\nsable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes\u2014for an Indian,\r\nOriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering\r\nexpression\u2014all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the\r\nunvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New\r\nEngland moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main.\r\nBut no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland,\r\nTashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring\r\nharpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look\r\nat the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the\r\nsuperstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and half believed this wild\r\nIndian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb\r\nthe second mate\u2019s squire.\r\n\n\r\nThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black negro-savage,\r\nwith a lion-like tread\u2014an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended from his ears\r\nwere two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called them ring-bolts, and\r\nwould talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had\r\nvoluntarily shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native\r\ncoast. And never having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket,\r\nand the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many\r\nyears the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of\r\nwhat manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and\r\nerect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in\r\nhis socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white man\r\nstanding before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress.\r\nCurious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of\r\nlittle Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the\r\nPequod\u2019s company, be it said, that at the present day not one in two of\r\nthe many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery,\r\nare Americans born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the\r\nsame with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and\r\nmerchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the\r\nAmerican Canals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the\r\nnative American liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as\r\ngenerously supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen\r\nbelong to the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently\r\ntouch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In\r\nlike manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the\r\nShetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the\r\npassage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,\r\nbut Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in\r\nthe Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging the common\r\ncontinent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate continent of his\r\nown. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An\r\nAnacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of\r\nthe earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world\u2019s\r\ngrievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back.\r\nBlack Little Pip\u2014he never did\u2014oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama\r\nboy! On the grim Pequod\u2019s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating\r\nhis tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great\r\nquarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine\r\nin glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!CHAPTER XXVIII.AHAB\n\r\nFor several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen of\r\nCaptain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches, and for\r\naught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the only commanders\r\nof the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden\r\nand peremptory, that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.\r\nYes, their supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any\r\neyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\r\n\n\r\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed aft\r\nto mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague disquietude\r\ntouching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, became almost a\r\nperturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged\r\nElijah\u2019s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a\r\nsubtle energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly could I\r\nwithstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the\r\nsolemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves. But whatever\r\nit was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness\u2014to call it so\u2014which I\r\nfelt, yet whenever I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all\r\nwarrantry to cherish such emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great\r\nbody of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any\r\nof the tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\r\nacquainted with, still I ascribed this\u2014and rightly ascribed it\u2014to\r\nthe fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in\r\nwhich I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the\r\nthree chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated\r\nto allay these colorless misgivings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness in\r\nevery presentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers and\r\nmen, each in his own different way, could not readily be found, and they were\r\nevery one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it\r\nbeing Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\r\nbiting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\r\nsouthward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,\r\ngradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind\r\nus. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough\r\nmornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through\r\nthe water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I\r\nmounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my\r\nglance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran\r\napprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.\r\n\n\r\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the recovery\r\nfrom any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has\r\noverrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away one\r\nparticle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole high, broad form,\r\nseemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like\r\nCellini\u2019s cast Perseus. Threading its way out from among his grey hairs,\r\nand continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it\r\ndisappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish.\r\nIt resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty\r\ntrunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\r\nwithout wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to\r\nbottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive,\r\nbut branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar\r\nleft by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit\r\nconsent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially\r\nby the mates. But once Tashtego\u2019s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among\r\nthe crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old\r\ndid Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the fury of\r\nany mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed\r\ninferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral\r\nman, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid\r\neye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the immemorial\r\ncredulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of\r\ndiscernment. So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said\r\nthat if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out\u2014which might\r\nhardly come to pass, so he muttered\u2014then, whoever should do that last\r\noffice for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\r\n\n\r\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid brand\r\nwhich streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a\r\nlittle of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon\r\nwhich he partly stood. It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at\r\nsea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale\u2019s jaw.\r\n\u201cAye, he was dismasted off Japan,\u201d said the old Gay-Head Indian\r\nonce; \u201cbut like his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without\r\ncoming home for it. He has a quiver of \u2019em.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of the\r\nPequod\u2019s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizen shrouds, there was\r\nan auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His bone leg\r\nsteadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab\r\nstood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship\u2019s ever-pitching prow.\r\nThere was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate unsurrenderable\r\nwilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a\r\nword he spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\r\nminutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\r\npainful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that,\r\nbut moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in\r\nall the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.\r\n\n\r\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But\r\nafter that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing in\r\nhis pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking the\r\ndeck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he\r\nbecame still less and less a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from\r\nhome, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so\r\nsecluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in\r\nthe air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last\r\nsunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was\r\nonly making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\r\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so that\r\nthere was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and\r\nthus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were\r\npiled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile\r\nthemselves upon.\r\n\n\r\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,\r\nholiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood. For,\r\nas when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry,\r\nmisanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak\r\nwill at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted\r\nvisitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings\r\nof that girlish air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a\r\nlook, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.CHAPTER XXIX.ENTER AHAB; TO HIM, STUBB\n\r\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went rolling\r\nthrough the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on\r\nthe threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly cool, clear,\r\nringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of\r\nPersian sherbet, heaped up\u2014flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred\r\nand stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in\r\nlonely pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted\r\nsuns! For sleeping man, \u2019twas hard to choose between such winsome days\r\nand such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did\r\nnot merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward they\r\nturned upon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on;\r\nthen, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless\r\ntwilights. And all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on\r\nAhab\u2019s texture.\r\n\n\r\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has\r\nto do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the old\r\ngreybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck. It\r\nwas so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open\r\nair, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from, the\r\ncabin to the planks. \u201cIt feels like going down into one\u2019s\r\ntomb,\u201d\u2014he would mutter to himself,\u2014\u201cfor an old captain\r\nlike me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug\r\nberth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were set, and\r\nthe band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and when if a rope\r\nwas to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as\r\nby day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place, for fear of\r\ndisturbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would\r\nbegin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the\r\ncabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, griping at the iron\r\nbanister, to help his crippled way. Some considerating touch of humanity was in\r\nhim; for at times like these, he usually abstained from patrolling the\r\nquarter-deck; because to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of\r\nhis ivory heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that\r\nbony step, that their dreams would have been of the crunching teeth of sharks.\r\nBut once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with\r\nheavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast,\r\nStubb, the odd second mate, came up from below, and with a certain unassured,\r\ndeprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the\r\nplanks, then, no one could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the\r\nnoise; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow,\r\nand the insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou did\u2019st not\r\nknow Ahab then.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I a cannon-ball, Stubb,\u201d said Ahab, \u201cthat thou wouldst\r\nwad me that fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;\r\nwhere such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at\r\nlast.\u2014Down, dog, and kennel!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStarting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful\r\nold man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, \u201cI am not\r\nused to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like it,\r\nsir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAvast!\u201d gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving\r\naway, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir; not yet,\u201d said Stubb, emboldened, \u201cI will not\r\ntamely be called a dog, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,\r\nor I\u2019ll clear the world of thee!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his\r\naspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,\u201d\r\nmuttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don\u2019t well\r\nknow whether to go back and strike him, or\u2014what\u2019s that?\u2014down\r\nhere on my knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me;\r\nbut it would be the first time I ever did pray. It\u2019s queer; very\r\nqueer; and he\u2019s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he\u2019s about\r\nthe queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!\u2014his\r\neyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway there\u2019s something on his mind,\r\nas sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed\r\nnow, either, more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don\u2019t\r\nsleep then. Didn\u2019t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning\r\nhe always finds the old man\u2019s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled,\r\nand the sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and\r\nthe pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A\r\nhot old man! I guess he\u2019s got what some folks ashore call a conscience;\r\nit\u2019s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say\u2014worse nor a toothache. Well,\r\nwell; I don\u2019t know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it.\r\nHe\u2019s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for,\r\nevery night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what\u2019s that for, I should\r\nlike to know? Who\u2019s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain\u2019t\r\nthat queer, now? But there\u2019s no telling, it\u2019s the old\r\ngame\u2014Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it\u2019s worth a fellow\u2019s\r\nwhile to be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I\r\nthink of it, that\u2019s about the first thing babies do, and that\u2019s a\r\nsort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of\r\n\u2019em. But that\u2019s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh\r\ncommandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth\u2014So here goes again.\r\nBut how\u2019s that? didn\u2019t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten\r\ntimes a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that! He might as\r\nwell have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me, and I\r\ndidn\u2019t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It\r\nflashed like a bleached bone. What the devil\u2019s the matter with me? I\r\ndon\u2019t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of\r\nturned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,\r\nthough\u2014How? how? how?\u2014but the only way\u2019s to stash it; so here\r\ngoes to hammock again; and in the morning, I\u2019ll see how this plaguey\r\njuggling thinks over by day-light.\u201dCHAPTER XXX.THE PIPE\n\r\nWhen Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks; and\r\nthen, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor of the watch, he\r\nsent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the\r\nbinnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat\r\nand smoked.\r\n\n\r\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated,\r\nsaith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one look at Ahab then,\r\nseated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the royalty it\r\nsymbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of\r\nLeviathans was Ahab.\r\n\n\r\nSome moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick\r\nand constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. \u201cHow\u201d now,\r\nhe soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, \u201cthis smoking no longer\r\nsoothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here have I\r\nbeen unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring,\u2014aye, and ignorantly smoking\r\nto windward all the while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if,\r\nlike the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.\r\nWhat business have I with this pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness,\r\nto send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey\r\nlocks like mine. I\u2019ll smoke no more\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves;\r\nthe same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With\r\nslouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.CHAPTER XXXI.QUEEN MAB\n\r\nNext morning Stubb accosted Flask.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSuch a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man\u2019s\r\nivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back,\r\nupon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab\r\nseemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was\r\nstill more curious, Flask\u2014you know how curious all dreams\r\nare\u2014through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking\r\nto myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.\r\n\u2018Why,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018what\u2019s the row? It\u2019s not a real\r\nleg, only a false leg.\u2019 And there\u2019s a mighty difference between a\r\nliving thump and a dead thump. That\u2019s what makes a blow from the hand,\r\nFlask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living\r\nmember\u2014that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to\r\nmyself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that\r\ncursed pyramid\u2014so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I\r\nsay, I was thinking to myself, \u2018what\u2019s his leg now, but a\r\ncane\u2014a whalebone cane. Yes,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018it was only a playful\r\ncudgelling\u2014in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me\u2014not a base\r\nkick. Besides,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018look at it once; why, the end of\r\nit\u2014the foot part\u2014what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a\r\nbroad footed farmer kicked me, there\u2019s a devilish broad insult.\r\nBut this insult is whittled down to a point only.\u2019 But now comes the\r\ngreatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a\r\nsort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the\r\nshoulders, and slews me round. \u2018What are you \u2019bout?\u2019 says he.\r\nSlid! man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was\r\nover the fright. \u2018What am I about?\u2019 says I at last. \u2018And what\r\nbusiness is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do you\r\nwant a kick?\u2019 By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he\r\nturned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he\r\nhad for a clout\u2014what do you think, I saw?\u2014why thunder alive, man,\r\nhis stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on\r\nsecond thoughts, \u2018I guess I won\u2019t kick you, old fellow.\u2019\r\n\u2018Wise Stubb,\u2019 said he, \u2018wise Stubb;\u2019 and kept muttering\r\nit all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he\r\nwasn\u2019t going to stop saying over his \u2018wise Stubb, wise\r\nStubb,\u2019 I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But\r\nI had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, \u2018Stop that\r\nkicking!\u2019 \u2018Halloa,\u2019 says I, \u2018what\u2019s the matter\r\nnow, old fellow?\u2019 \u2018Look ye here,\u2019 says he; \u2018let\u2019s\r\nargue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn\u2019t he?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\r\nhe did,\u2019 says I\u2014\u2018right here it was.\u2019 \u2018Very\r\ngood,\u2019 says he\u2014\u2018he used his ivory leg, didn\u2019t\r\nhe?\u2019 \u2018Yes, he did,\u2019 says I. \u2018Well then,\u2019 says he,\r\n\u2018wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn\u2019t he kick with\r\nright good will? it wasn\u2019t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was\r\nit? No, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.\r\nIt\u2019s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England\r\nthe greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made\r\ngarter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old\r\nAhab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; be kicked by him;\r\naccount his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can\u2019t help\r\nyourself, wise Stubb. Don\u2019t you see that pyramid?\u2019 With that, he\r\nall of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the\r\nair. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do you\r\nthink of that dream, Flask?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho\u2019.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMay be, may be. But it\u2019s made a wise man of me, Flask. D\u2019ye\r\nsee Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing\r\nyou can do, Flask, is to let that old man alone; never speak to him, whatever\r\nhe says. Halloa! what\u2019s that he shouts? Hark!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts! If\r\nye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat d\u2019ye think of that now, Flask? ain\u2019t there a small drop\r\nof something queer about that, eh? A white whale\u2014did ye mark that, man?\r\nLook ye\u2014there\u2019s something special in the wind. Stand by for it,\r\nFlask. Ahab has that that\u2019s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this\r\nway.\u201dCHAPTER XXXII.CETOLOGY\n\r\nAlready we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its\r\nunshored, harborless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequod\u2019s\r\nweedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the\r\noutset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough\r\nappreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and\r\nallusions of all sorts which are to follow.\r\n\n\r\nIt is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I\r\nwould now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The classification of\r\nthe constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what the\r\nbest and latest authorities have laid down.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled\r\nCetology,\u201d says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry\r\nas to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families. * * *\r\nUtter confusion exists among the historians of this animal\u201d (sperm\r\nwhale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUnfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.\u201d\r\nImpenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea. \u201cA field strewn\r\nwith thorns.\u201d \u201cAll these incomplete indications but serve to\r\ntorture us naturalists.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson, those\r\nlights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be\r\nlittle, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some small degree, with\r\ncetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men, small and great, old and\r\nnew, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale.\r\nRun over a few:\u2014The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi;\r\nSir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linn\u00e6us; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green;\r\nArtedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron\r\nCuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross\r\nBrowne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to\r\nwhat ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited\r\nextracts will show.\r\n\n\r\nOf the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever saw\r\nliving whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and\r\nwhaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland or\r\nright-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and\r\nsays nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale\r\nis almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is\r\nan usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest\r\nof the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound\r\nignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous and\r\nutterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still\r\nreigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation\r\nhas been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions\r\nin the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,\r\nwithout one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at\r\nlast come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people\r\nall,\u2014the Greenland whale is deposed,\u2014the great sperm whale now\r\nreigneth!\r\n\n\r\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm\r\nwhale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the\r\nattempt. Those books are Beale\u2019s and Bennett\u2019s; both in their time\r\nsurgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The\r\noriginal matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is\r\nnecessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though\r\nmostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale,\r\nscientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other\r\nhunted whales, his is an unwritten life.\r\n\n\r\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive\r\nclassification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be\r\nfilled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances\r\nto take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise\r\nnothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for\r\nthat very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute\r\nanatomical description of the various species, or\u2014in this place at\r\nleast\u2014to much of any description. My object here is simply to project the\r\ndraught of a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.\r\n\n\r\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-office is\r\nequal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to have\r\none\u2019s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of\r\nthe world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the\r\nnose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me.\r\n\u201cWill he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the hope of\r\nhim is vain!\u201d But I have swam through libraries and sailed through\r\noceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest;\r\nand I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.\r\n\n\r\nFirst: the uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the\r\nvery vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a\r\nmoot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature,\r\nA.D. 1776, Linn\u00e6us declares, \u201cI hereby separate the whales\r\nfrom the fish.\u201d But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year\r\n1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linn\u00e6us\u2019s express\r\nedict, were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\r\nLeviathan.\r\n\n\r\nThe grounds upon which Linn\u00e6us would fain have banished the whales from the\r\nwaters, he states as follows: \u201cOn account of their warm bilocular heart,\r\ntheir lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam\r\nmammis lactantem,\u201d and finally, \u201cex lege natur\u00e6 jure\r\nmeritoque.\u201d I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\r\nCoffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they\r\nunited in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient.\r\nCharley profanely hinted they were humbug.\r\n\n\r\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground\r\nthat the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental\r\nthing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale\r\ndiffer from other fish. Above, Linn\u00e6us has given you those items. But in brief,\r\nthey are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and\r\ncold blooded.\r\n\n\r\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\r\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is\r\na spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him. However\r\ncontracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus\r\nspouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is\r\namphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as\r\ncoupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish\r\nfamiliar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail.\r\nWhereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped,\r\ninvariably assumes a horizontal position.\r\n\n\r\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the\r\nleviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by\r\nthe best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish\r\nhitherto authoritatively regarded as alien[3].\r\nHence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included\r\nin this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the\r\nentire whale host.\r\n\n  [3] I\r\nam aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs\r\n(Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many\r\nnaturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a nosy, contemptible\r\nset, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and\r\nespecially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have\r\npresented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\r\n\n\r\nFirst: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS\r\n(subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them\r\nall, both small and large.\r\n\n\r\nI. The FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO\r\nWHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.\r\n\n\r\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale; of\r\nthe OCTAVO, the Grampus; of the DUODECIMO,\r\nthe Porpoise.\r\n\n\r\nFOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:\u2014I. The\r\nSperm Whale; II. the Right Whale; III. the Fin Back Whale;\r\nIV. the Hump-backed Whale; V. the Razor Back Whale; VI. the\r\nSulphur Bottom Whale.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm\r\nWhale).\u2014This whale, among the English of old vaguely known as the\r\nTrumpa whale, and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the\r\npresent Cachalot of the French, and the Pottfisch of the Germans, and the\r\nMacrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant\r\nof the globe; the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic\r\nin aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the only\r\ncreature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his\r\npeculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with\r\nhis name that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some\r\ncenturies ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper\r\nindividuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the\r\nstranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed\r\nto be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in England as\r\nthe Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti\r\nwas that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of\r\nthe word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly\r\nscarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It\r\nwas only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb.\r\nWhen, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became\r\nknown, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance\r\nits value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the\r\nappellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which\r\nthis spermaceti was really derived.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right\r\nWhale).\u2014In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans,\r\nbeing the one first regularly hunted by man. It yields the article commonly\r\nknown as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially known as \u201cwhale\r\noil,\u201d an inferior article in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is\r\nindiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the\r\nGreenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right\r\nWhale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus\r\nmultitudinously baptized. What then is the whale, which I include in the second\r\nspecies of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists;\r\nthe Greenland Whale of the English Whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the\r\nFrench whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for\r\nmore than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the\r\nArctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in\r\nthe Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor\u2019 West Coast, and\r\nvarious other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising\r\nGrounds.\r\n\n\r\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and\r\nthe right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in all their grand\r\nfeatures; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which\r\nto ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the\r\nmost inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become\r\nso repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some\r\nlength, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III.\r\n(Fin-Back).\u2014Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the\r\nvarious names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in\r\nevery sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by\r\npassengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length\r\nhe attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is\r\nof a less portly girth, and a lighter color, approaching to olive. His great\r\nlips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds\r\nof large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he\r\nderives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three or four\r\nfeet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular\r\nshape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part\r\nof the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly\r\nprojecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly\r\nmarked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts\r\nshadows upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery\r\ncircle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy\r\nhour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The\r\nFin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters.\r\nVery shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the\r\nremotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like\r\na tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power\r\nand velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this\r\nleviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for\r\nhis mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the\r\nFin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species\r\ndenominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so\r\ncalled Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of\r\nwhich, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales;\r\npike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales,\r\nare the fishermen\u2019s names for a few sorts.\r\n\n\r\nIn connexion with this appellative of \u201cWhalebone whales,\u201d it is of\r\ngreat importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient\r\nin facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt\r\na clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or\r\nhump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features\r\nvery obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of\r\nCetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his\r\nkinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are\r\nthings whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of\r\nwhales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\r\nother and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\r\nwhale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same\r\nhumpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there\r\nagain the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above\r\nmentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations;\r\nor, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as\r\nutterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this\r\nrock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.\r\n\n\r\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in\r\nhis anatomy\u2014there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right\r\nclassification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland\r\nwhale\u2019s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by\r\nhis baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And if\r\nyou descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you will not\r\nfind distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those\r\nexternal ones already enumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold\r\nof the whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that\r\nway. And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only\r\none that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.\r\n\n\r\nBook I. (Folio), CHAPTER IV. (Hump\r\nBack).\u2014this whale is often seen on the northern American coast. He\r\nhas been frequently captured there, and towed into harbor. He has a great pack\r\non him like a peddler; or you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At\r\nany rate, the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since\r\nthe sperm whale also has a hump, though a smaller one. His oil is not very\r\nvaluable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the\r\nwhales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER V. (Razor Back).\u2014Of\r\nthis whale little is known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape\r\nHorn. Of a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no\r\ncoward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a\r\nlong sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does anybody else.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER VI. (Sulphur\r\nBottom).\u2014Another retiring gentleman, with a brimstone belly,\r\ndoubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder\r\ndivings. He is seldom seen; at least I have never seen him except in the\r\nremoter southern seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his\r\ncountenance. He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line.\r\nProdigies are told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that\r\nis true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.\r\n\n\r\nThus ends BOOK I. (Folio), and now begins BOOK II. (Octavo).\r\n\n\r\nOCTAVOES.[4] These\r\nembrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which at present may be\r\nnumbered:\u2014I., the Grampus; II., the Black Fish; III., the\r\nNarwhale; IV., the Thrasher; V., the Killer.\r\n\n  [4]\r\nWhy this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain. Because,\r\nwhile the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former order,\r\nnevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the\r\nbookbinder\u2019s Quarto volume in its diminished form does not preserve the\r\nshape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER I.\r\n(Grampus).\u2014Though this fish, whose loud sonorous breathing, or\r\nrather blowing, has furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so well known a denizen\r\nof the deep, yet is he not popularly classed among whales. But possessing all\r\nthe grand distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have\r\nrecognised him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to\r\ntwenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He\r\nswims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in\r\nquantity, and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded\r\nas premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER II. (Black\r\nFish).\u2014I give the popular fishermen\u2019s names for all these fish,\r\nfor generally they are the best. Where any name happens to be vague or\r\ninexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest another. I do so now, touching the\r\nBlack Fish, so called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales.\r\nSo, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and\r\nfrom the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\r\ncarries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale averages\r\nsome sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost all latitudes.\r\nHe has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks\r\nsomething like a Roman nose. When not more profitably employed, the sperm whale\r\nhunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil\r\nfor domestic employment\u2014as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of\r\ncompany, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous\r\nwax. Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you\r\nupwards of thirty gallons of oil.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that\r\nis, Nostril whale.\u2014Another instance of a curiously named whale, so\r\nnamed I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked\r\nnose. The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\r\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\r\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a\r\nline a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the\r\nsinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to\r\nthe aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or\r\nlance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used like the\r\nblade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the\r\nNarwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food.\r\nCharley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to\r\nthe surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn\r\nup, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be\r\ncorrect. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used\r\nby the Narwhale\u2014however that may be\u2014it would certainly be very\r\nconvenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard\r\ncalled the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is\r\ncertainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every\r\nkingdom of animated nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered\r\nthat this same sea-unicorn\u2019s horn was in ancient days regarded as the\r\ngreat antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense\r\nprices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same\r\nway that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally\r\nit was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells me\r\nthat Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did\r\ngallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace, as\r\nhis bold ship sailed down the Thames; \u201cwhen Sir Martin returned from that\r\nvoyage,\u201d saith Black Letter, \u201con bended knees he presented to her\r\nhighness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after\r\nhung in the castle at Windsor.\u201d An Irish author avers that the Earl of\r\nLeicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,\r\npertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.\r\n\n\r\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white\r\nground color, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His oil is very\r\nsuperior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted.\r\nHe is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer).\u2014Of\r\nthis whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to\r\nthe professed naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should\r\nsay that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage\u2014a sort\r\nof Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and hangs\r\nthere like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The Killer is\r\nnever hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception might be taken\r\nto the name bestowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indistinctness. For\r\nwe are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V.\r\n(Thrasher).\u2014This gentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses\r\nfor a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts the Folio whale\u2019s back, and\r\nas he swims, he works his passage by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get\r\nalong in the world by a similar process. Still less is known of the Thrasher\r\nthan of the Killer. Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.\r\n\n\r\nThus ends BOOK II. (Octavo), and begins BOOK III. (Duodecimo).\r\n\n\r\nDUODECIMOES.\u2014These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise. II.\r\nThe Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\r\n\n\r\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly\r\nseem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be\r\nmarshalled among WHALES\u2014a word, which, in the popular sense, always\r\nconveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes\r\nare infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale\r\nis\u2014i. e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER I (Huzza\r\nPorpoise).\u2014This is the common porpoise found almost all over the\r\nglobe. The name is of my own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of\r\nporpoises, and something must be done to distinguish them. I call them thus,\r\nbecause he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep\r\ntossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their\r\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine\r\nspirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the\r\nlads that always live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you\r\nyourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then\r\nheaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed,\r\nplump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine\r\nand delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in\r\nrequest among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones.\r\nPorpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that\r\na porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very readily\r\ndiscernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and you will then\r\nsee the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER II. (Algerine\r\nPorpoise).\u2014A pirate. Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the\r\nPacific. He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same\r\ngeneral make. Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for\r\nhim many times, but never yet saw him captured.\r\n\n\r\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mouthed\r\nPorpoise). The largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so\r\nfar as it is known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been\r\ndesignated, is that of the fishers\u2014Right-Whale Porpoise, from the\r\ncircumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape,\r\nhe differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and\r\njolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no\r\nfins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and\r\nsentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though\r\nhis entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line,\r\ndistinct as the mark in a ship\u2019s hull, called the \u201cbright\r\nwaist,\u201d that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate\r\ncolors, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his head, and\r\nthe whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a\r\nfelonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much\r\nlike that of the common porpoise.\r\n\n\r\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as\r\nthe Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans\r\nof note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales,\r\nwhich, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally. I\r\nshall enumerate them by their forecastle appellations; for possibly such a list\r\nmay be valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but\r\nbegun. If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked,\r\nthen he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio,\r\nOctavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:\u2014The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale;\r\nthe Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale;\r\nthe Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale;\r\nthe Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English\r\nauthorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed\r\nwith all manner of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and\r\ncan hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but\r\nsignifying nothing.\r\n\n\r\nFinally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and\r\nat once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word. But I\r\nnow leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even as the great\r\nCathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top of\r\nthe uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished by their first\r\narchitects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God\r\nkeep me from ever completing anything. This whole book is but a\r\ndraught\u2014nay, but the draught of a draught. Oh Time, Strength, Cash, and\r\nPatience!CHAPTER XXXIII.THE SPECKSNYDER\n\r\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any\r\nto set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the\r\nexistence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course in any\r\nother marine than the whale-fleet.\r\n\n\r\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer\u2019s vocation is evinced by\r\nthe fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more ago,\r\nthe command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the\r\ncaptain, but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksnyder.\r\nLiterally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it\r\nequivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain\u2019s authority\r\nwas restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel: while\r\nover the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or\r\nChief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the\r\ncorrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\r\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as senior\r\nHarpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain\u2019s more inferior\r\nsubalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the\r\nsuccess of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American Fishery\r\nhe is not only an important officer in the boat, but under certain\r\ncircumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the command of the\r\nship\u2019s deck is also his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea\r\ndemands, that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and\r\nbe in some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always, by\r\nthem, familiarly regarded as their social equal.\r\n\n\r\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\r\nthis\u2014the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\r\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too,\r\nin most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of\r\nthe ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the captain\u2019s cabin,\r\nand sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.\r\n\n\r\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of all\r\nvoyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the community\r\nof interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or low, depend for\r\ntheir profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck, together with\r\ntheir common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do\r\nin some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen\r\ngenerally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these\r\nwhalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for all that, the\r\npunctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially\r\nrelaxed, and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\r\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\r\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much\r\noutward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of\r\npilot-cloth.\r\n\n\r\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to\r\nthat sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever exacted,\r\nwas implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man to remove the\r\nshoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and though there were\r\ntimes when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to\r\nbe detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or\r\nin terrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means\r\nunobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\r\n\n\r\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those forms\r\nand usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally making use of\r\nthem for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to\r\nsubserve. That certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a good\r\ndegree remained unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became\r\nincarnate in an irresistible dictatorship. For be a man\u2019s intellectual\r\nsuperiority what it will, it can never assume the practical, available\r\nsupremacy over other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\r\nentrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is,\r\nthat for ever keeps God\u2019s true princes of the Empire from the\r\nworld\u2019s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can give,\r\nto those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the\r\nchoice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted\r\nsuperiority over the dead level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these\r\nsmall things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some\r\nroyal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency. But when,\r\nas in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire\r\nencircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the\r\ntremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would depict\r\nmortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a\r\nhint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one now alluded to.\r\n\n\r\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and\r\nshagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must not conceal\r\nthat I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him; and, therefore,\r\nall outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what\r\nshall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived\r\nfor in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!CHAPTER XXXIV.THE CABIN-TABLE\n\r\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread face\r\nfrom the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master; who, sitting\r\nin the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of the sun; and is\r\nnow mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet,\r\nreserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg. From his\r\ncomplete inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not\r\nheard his menial. But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings\r\nhimself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying,\r\n\u201cDinner, Mr. Starbuck,\u201d disappears into the cabin.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the last echo of his sultan\u2019s step has died away, and Starbuck, the\r\nfirst Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck rouses\r\nfrom his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep\r\ninto the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, \u201cDinner, Mr.\r\nStubb,\u201d and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges about the\r\nrigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see whether it be\r\nall right with that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and\r\nwith a rapid \u201cDinner, Mr. Flask,\u201d follows after his predecessors.\r\n\n\r\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck, seems to\r\nfeel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts of knowing\r\nwinks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a\r\nsharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk\u2019s\r\nhead; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop\r\nfor a shelf, he goes down rollicking, so far at least as he remains visible\r\nfrom the deck, reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with\r\nmusic. But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new\r\nface altogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King\r\nAhab\u2019s presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\r\n\n\r\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness\r\nof sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some officers will, upon\r\nprovocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their\r\ncommander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to\r\ntheir customary dinner in that same commander\u2019s cabin, and straightway\r\ntheir inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he\r\nsits at the head of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.\r\nWherefore this difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar,\r\nKing of Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,\r\ntherein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in\r\nthe rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private\r\ndinner-table of invited guests, that man\u2019s unchallenged power and\r\ndominion of individual influence for the time; that man\u2019s royalty of\r\nstate transcends Belshazzar\u2019s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who\r\nhas but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be C\u00e6sar. It is a\r\nwitchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding. Now, if to this\r\nconsideration you superadd the official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by\r\ninference, you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\n\r\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on the\r\nwhite coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs. In his\r\nown proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were as little children\r\nbefore Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest social\r\narrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old\r\nman\u2019s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him. I do not suppose\r\nthat for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest\r\nobservation, even upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching\r\nout his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\r\nthereby motioned Starbuck\u2019s plate towards him, the mate received his meat\r\nas though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started if,\r\nperchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and\r\nswallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at\r\nFrankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial\r\nElectors, so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful\r\nsilence; and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself\r\nwas dumb. What a relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden\r\nracket in the hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and\r\nlittle boy of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline\r\nbeef; his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\r\nhimself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first\r\ndegree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he\r\nhave been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless, strange\r\nto say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the chances were\r\nAhab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask presume to help\r\nhimself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him,\r\non account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed\r\nthat, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium,\r\nand therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a\r\nbutterless man!\r\n\n\r\nAnother thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is the\r\nfirst man up. Consider! For hereby Flask\u2019s dinner was badly jammed in\r\npoint of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they also\r\nhave the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg\r\nhigher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows\r\nsymptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not\r\nget more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb\r\nto precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in\r\nprivate, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that\r\nmoment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or\r\nless. For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal\r\nin him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my\r\nstomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fist a bit of old-fashioned\r\nbeef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There\u2019s\r\nthe fruits of promotion now; there\u2019s the vanity of glory: there\u2019s\r\nthe insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod\r\nhad a grudge against Flask in Flask\u2019s official capacity, all that sailor\r\nhad to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time,\r\nand get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and\r\ndumfoundered before awful Ahab.\r\n\n\r\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the\r\nPequod\u2019s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order to\r\ntheir arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to some\r\nhurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers were bidden\r\nto the feast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a sort of temporary\r\nservants\u2019 hall of the high and mighty cabin.\r\n\n\r\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible\r\ndomineerings of the captain\u2019s table, was the entire care-free license and\r\nease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers.\r\nWhile their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of\r\ntheir own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there\r\nwas a report to it. They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like\r\nIndian ships all day loading with spices. Such portentous appetites had\r\nQueequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous\r\nrepast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of\r\nsalt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively\r\nabout it, if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had\r\nan ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\r\nharpoonwise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\r\nDough-Boy\u2019s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\r\ninto a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying\r\nout the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous,\r\nshuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny of a\r\nbankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of\r\nthe black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these\r\nthree savages, Dough-Boy\u2019s whole life was one continual lip-quiver.\r\nCommonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded,\r\nhe would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\r\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was over.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his filed\r\nteeth to the Indian\u2019s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the floor, for\r\na bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every\r\nmotion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when\r\nan African elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great negro\r\nwas wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that\r\nby such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused\r\nthrough so broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble\r\nsavage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\r\nhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or\r\nby bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric\r\nsmack of the lip in eating\u2014an ugly sound enough\u2014so much so, that\r\nthe trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked\r\nin his own lean arms. And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to\r\nproduce himself, that his bones might be picked, the simple-witted Steward all\r\nbut shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits\r\nof the palsy. Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their\r\npockets, for their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at\r\ndinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\r\nnot at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his\r\nIsland days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some\r\nmurderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white\r\nwaiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a\r\nbuckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three salt-sea\r\nwarriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all\r\ntheir martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in\r\nscabbards.\r\n\n\r\nBut, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived there;\r\nstill, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were scarcely ever in\r\nit except at meal-times, and just before sleeping-time, when they passed\r\nthrough it to their own peculiar quarters.\r\n\n\r\nIn this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains,\r\nwho, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship\u2019s\r\ncabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is,\r\nat any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers\r\nof the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than\r\nin it. For when they did enter it, it was something as a street-door enters a\r\nhouse; turning inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a\r\npermanent thing, residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in\r\nthe cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though\r\nnominally included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it.\r\nHe lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\r\nMissouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the\r\nwoods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there,\r\nsucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab\u2019s soul,\r\nshut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its\r\ngloom!CHAPTER XXXV.THE MAST-HEAD\n\r\nIt was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the other\r\nseamen my first mast-head came round.\r\n\n\r\nIn most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with\r\nthe vessel\u2019s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen thousand\r\nmiles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground. And if, after\r\na three, four, or five years\u2019 voyage she is drawing nigh home with\r\nanything empty in her\u2014say, an empty vial even\u2014then, her mast-heads\r\nare kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the\r\nspires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one\r\nwhale more.\r\n\n\r\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very\r\nancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it,\r\nthat the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians; because, in\r\nall my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their progenitors, the\r\nbuilders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the\r\nloftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\r\nput to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the\r\nboard, in the dread gale of God\u2019s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these\r\nBabel builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a\r\nnation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief\r\namong arch\u00e6ologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical\r\npurposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of\r\nall four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of\r\ntheir legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out\r\nfor new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a\r\nwhale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of\r\nold times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\r\nlatter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground\r\nwith a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\r\nstander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or\r\nfrosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the last,\r\nliterally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a\r\nlifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well capable of\r\nfacing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business of\r\nsinging out upon discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon\r\nthe top of the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\r\nfifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis\r\nPhilippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high\r\naloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules\u2019\r\npillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals\r\nwill go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head\r\nin Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke, token is\r\nyet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire.\r\nBut neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single\r\nhail from below, however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the\r\ndistracted decks upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their\r\nspirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals\r\nand what rocks must be shunned.\r\n\n\r\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of\r\nthe land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is plainly\r\nevinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of Nantucket, stands\r\naccountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale\r\nfishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people\r\nof that island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs\r\nascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a\r\nhen-house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of\r\nNew Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned\r\nboats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to\r\nthe one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are\r\nkept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as\r\nat the helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather\r\nof the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy\r\nmeditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the\r\nsilent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts,\r\nwhile beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters\r\nof the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus\r\nat old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with\r\nnothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy\r\ntrade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the most part, in\r\nthis tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no\r\nnews; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never\r\ndelude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions;\r\nbankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of\r\nwhat you shall have for dinner\u2014for all your meals for three years and\r\nmore are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.\r\n\n\r\nIn one of those southern whalemen, on a long three or four years\u2019 voyage,\r\nas often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would\r\namount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that the place\r\nto which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural\r\nlife, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy\r\ninhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as\r\npertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any\r\nother of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate\r\nthemselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t\u2019\r\ngallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to\r\nwhalemen) called the t\u2019 gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the\r\nsea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull\u2019s\r\nhorns. To be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in\r\nthe shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no\r\nmore of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its\r\nfleshly tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of\r\nit, without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing\r\nthe snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a\r\nmere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest\r\nof drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of your\r\nwatch-coat.\r\n\n\r\nConcerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\r\nsouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits,\r\ncalled crow\u2019s-nests, in which the lookouts of a Greenland whaler\r\nare protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the fire-side\r\nnarrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \u201cA Voyage among the Icebergs, in\r\nquest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost\r\nIcelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\u201d in this admirable volume, all\r\nstanders of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account\r\nof the then recently invented crow\u2019s-nest of the Glacier, which\r\nwas the name of Captain Sleet\u2019s good craft. He called it the\r\nSleet\u2019s crow\u2019s-nest, in honor of himself; he being the\r\noriginal inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy,\r\nand holding that if we call our own children after our own names (we fathers\r\nbeing the original inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate\r\nafter ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet\u2019s\r\ncrow\u2019s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above,\r\nhowever, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward\r\nof your head in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend\r\ninto it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side\r\nnext the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for\r\numbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep\r\nyour speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When\r\nCaptain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow\u2019s nest of his,\r\nhe tells us that he always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack),\r\ntogether with a powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray\r\nnarwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\r\nsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water,\r\nbut to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a\r\nlabor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little\r\ndetailed conveniences of his crow\u2019s-nest; but though he so enlarges upon\r\nmany of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his\r\nexperiments in this crow\u2019s-nest, with a small compass he kept there for\r\nthe purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the\r\n\u201clocal attraction\u201d of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to\r\nthe horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship\u2019s planks, and in the\r\nGlacier\u2019s case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down\r\nblacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and\r\nscientific here, yet, for all his learned \u201cbinnacle deviations,\u201d\r\n\u201cazimuth compass observations,\u201d and \u201capproximate\r\nerrors,\u201d he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much\r\nimmersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted\r\noccasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked\r\nin on one side of his crow\u2019s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though,\r\nupon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and\r\nlearned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore\r\nthat case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have\r\nbeen, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the\r\nmathematics aloft there in that bird\u2019s nest within three or four perches\r\nof the pole.\r\n\n\r\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain\r\nSleet and his Greenland-men were; yet that disadvantage is greatly\r\ncounterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in\r\nwhich we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging\r\nvery leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one\r\nelse off duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little way further, and\r\nthrowing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the\r\nwatery pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.\r\n\n\r\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but sorry\r\nguard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could\r\nI\u2014being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering\r\naltitude,\u2014how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\r\nwhale-ships\u2019 standing orders, \u201cKeep your weather eye open, and sing\r\nout every time.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of Nantucket!\r\nBeware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and\r\nhollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who offers to ship with\r\nthe Ph\u00e6don instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of such an one, I say; your\r\nwhales must be seen before they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young\r\nPlatonist will tow you ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint\r\nof sperm the richer. Nor are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the\r\nwhale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and\r\nabsent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\r\nsentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself\r\nupon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody\r\nphrase ejaculates:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRoll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!\r\nTen thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nVery often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young\r\nphilosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient\r\n\u201cinterest\u201d in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly\r\nlost to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather\r\nnot see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists have a\r\nnotion that their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then,\r\nto strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses at home.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, thou monkey,\u201d said a harpooneer to one of these lads,\r\n\u201cwe\u2019ve been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not\r\nraised a whale yet. Whales are scarce as hen\u2019s teeth whenever thou art up\r\nhere.\u201d Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them\r\nin the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant,\r\nunconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of\r\nwaves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean\r\nat his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul,\r\npervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful\r\nthing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some\r\nundiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that\r\nonly people the soul by continually flitting through it. In this enchanted\r\nmood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and\r\nspace; like Cranmer\u2019s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part\r\nof every shore the round globe over.\r\n\n\r\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a gently\r\nrolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the inscrutable\r\ntides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand\r\nan inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror. Over\r\nDescartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather,\r\nwith one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the\r\nsummer sea, no more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!CHAPTER XXXVI.THE QUARTER-DECK\n\r\n(enter Ahab: Then, all.)\r\n\n\r\nIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning shortly\r\nafter breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.\r\nThere most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after\r\nthe same meal, take a few turns in the garden.\r\n\n\r\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds,\r\nupon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over dented, like\r\ngeological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did you fixedly gaze,\r\ntoo, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger\r\nfoot-prints\u2014the foot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\r\n\n\r\nBut on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous\r\nstep that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab,\r\nthat at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the\r\nbinnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace\r\nin him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but\r\nseemed the inward mould of every outer movement.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cD\u2019ye mark him, Flask?\u201d whispered Stubb; \u201cthe chick\r\nthat\u2019s in him pecks the shell. \u2019Twill soon be out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe hours wore on;\u2014Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the\r\ndeck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\r\n\n\r\nIt drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks, and\r\ninserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand grasping a\r\nshroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir!\u201d said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given\r\non ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSend everybody aft,\u201d repeated Ahab. \u201cMast-heads, there! come\r\ndown!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen the entire ship\u2019s company were assembled, and with curious and not\r\nwholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the\r\nweather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing over\r\nthe bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his\r\nstandpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon\r\nthe deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful\r\nof the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to\r\nFlask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a\r\npedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he\r\ncried:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSing out for him!\u201d was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of\r\nclubbed voices.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing\r\nthe hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically\r\nthrown them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what do ye next, men?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLower away, and after him!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what tune is it ye pull to, men?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA dead whale or a stove boat!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the countenance\r\nof the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at\r\neach other, as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited\r\nat such seemingly purposeless questions.\r\n\n\r\nBut, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\r\npivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost\r\nconvulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white\r\nwhale. Look ye! d\u2019ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\u201d\u2014holding\r\nup a broad bright coin to the sun\u2014\u201cit is a sixteen dollar piece,\r\nmen. D\u2019ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly\r\nrubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its\r\nlustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself,\r\nproducing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the\r\nmechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.\r\n\n\r\nReceiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast with\r\nthe hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a\r\nhigh raised voice exclaiming: \u201cWhosoever of ye raises me a white-headed\r\nwhale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that\r\nwhite-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard\r\nfluke\u2014look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall\r\nhave this gold ounce, my boys!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHuzza! huzza!\u201d cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\r\nhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a white whale, I say,\u201d resumed Ahab, as he threw down\r\nthe top-maul; \u201ca white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for\r\nwhite water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more\r\nintense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled\r\nbrow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some\r\nspecific recollection.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Tashtego, \u201cthat white whale must be the\r\nsame that some call Moby Dick.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMoby Dick?\u201d shouted Ahab. \u201cDo ye know the white whale then,\r\nTash?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDoes he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\u201d said\r\nthe Gay-Header deliberately.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd has he a curious spout,\u201d too, said Daggoo, \u201cvery bushy,\r\neven for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd he have one, two, tree\u2014oh! good many iron in him hide, too,\r\nCaptain,\u201d cried Queequeg disjointedly, \u201call twiske-tee betwisk,\r\nlike him\u2014him\u2014\u201d faltering hard for a word, and screwing his\r\nhand round and round as though uncorking a bottle\u2014\u201clike\r\nhim\u2014him\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCorkscrew!\u201d cried Ahab, \u201caye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all\r\ntwisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole\r\nshock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great\r\nannual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a\r\nsquall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen\u2014Moby\r\nDick\u2014Moby Dick!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus\r\nfar been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed\r\nstruck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. \u201cCaptain\r\nAhab, I have heard of Moby Dick\u2014but it was not Moby Dick that took off\r\nthy leg?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho told thee that?\u201d cried Ahab; then pausing, \u201cAye,\r\nStarbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby\r\nDick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\u201d he\r\nshouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;\r\n\u201cAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor\r\npegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\u201d Then tossing both arms, with\r\nmeasureless imprecations he shouted out: \u201cAye, aye! and I\u2019ll chase\r\nhim round Good Hope, and round the horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and\r\nround perdition\u2019s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have\r\nshipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all\r\nsides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye, men,\r\nwill ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye!\u201d shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to\r\nthe excited old man: \u201cA sharp eye for the White Whale; a sharp lance for\r\nMoby Dick!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod bless ye,\u201d he seemed to half sob and half shout. \u201cGod\r\nbless ye, men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what\u2019s\r\nthis long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art\r\nnot game for Moby Dick?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\r\nAhab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came here\r\nto hunt whales, not my commander\u2019s vengeance. How many barrels will thy\r\nvengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch\r\nthee much in our Nantucket market.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a\r\nlittle lower layer. If money\u2019s to be the measurer, man, and the\r\naccountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by girdling it\r\nwith guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let me tell thee, that\r\nmy vengeance will fetch a great premium here!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe smites his chest,\u201d whispered Stubb, \u201cwhat\u2019s that\r\nfor? methinks it rings most vast, but hollow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVengeance on a dumb brute!\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201cthat simply\r\nsmote thee from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,\r\nCaptain Ahab, seems blasphemous.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHark ye yet again,\u2014the little lower layer. All visible objects,\r\nman, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event\u2014in the living act,\r\nthe undoubted deed\u2014there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts\r\nforth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man\r\nwill strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except\r\nby thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near\r\nto me. Sometimes I think there\u2019s naught beyond. But \u2019tis enough. He\r\ntasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable\r\nmalice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the\r\nwhite whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon\r\nhim. Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I\u2019d strike the sun if it insulted\r\nme. For could the sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a\r\nsort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my\r\nmaster, man, is even that fair play. Who\u2019s over me? Truth hath no\r\nconfines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends\u2019 glarings is a\r\ndoltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to\r\nanger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays\r\nitself. There are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not to\r\nincense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted\r\ntawn\u2014living, breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan\r\nleopards\u2014the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and\r\ngive no reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are\r\nthey not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he\r\nlaughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general\r\nhurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it.\r\n\u2019Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it\r\nmore? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket,\r\nsurely he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a\r\nwhetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee! Speak,\r\nbut speak!\u2014Aye, aye! thy silence, then, that voices thee.\r\n(aside) something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in\r\nhis lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without\r\nrebellion.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGod keep me!\u2014keep us all!\u201d murmured Starbuck, lowly.\r\n\n\r\nBut in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not\r\nhear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold; nor yet\r\nthe presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap\r\nof the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in. For again\r\nStarbuck\u2019s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the\r\nsubterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship\r\nheaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not\r\nwhen ye come? But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not\r\nso much predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things\r\nwithin. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in\r\nour being, these still drive us on.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe measure! the measure!\u201d cried Ahab.\r\n\n\r\nReceiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered them\r\nto produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near the capstan, with\r\ntheir harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood at his side with\r\ntheir lances, and the rest of the ship\u2019s company formed a circle round\r\nthe group; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew.\r\nBut those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet\r\nthe eye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the\r\nbison; but, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDrink and pass!\u201d he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\r\nnearest seaman. \u201cThe crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\r\ndraughts\u2014long swallows, men; \u2019tis hot as Satan\u2019s hoof. So,\r\nso; it goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\r\nserpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this way it\r\ncomes. Hand it me\u2014here\u2019s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so\r\nbrimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAttend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye\r\nmates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with your\r\nirons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort revive a\r\nnoble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will yet see\r\nthat\u2014Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner. Hand it me. Why,\r\nnow, this pewter had run brimming again, wer\u2019t not thou St. Vitus\u2019\r\nimp\u2014away, thou ague!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAdvance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me\r\ntouch the axis.\u201d So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three\r\nlevel, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and\r\nnervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb;\r\nfrom Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some nameless, interior volition,\r\nhe would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within\r\nthe Leyden jar of his own magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his\r\nstrong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him;\r\nthe honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn vain!\u201d cried Ahab; \u201cbut, maybe, \u2019tis well. For did\r\nye three but once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing,\r\nthat had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have\r\ndropped ye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do\r\nappoint ye three cup-bearers to my three pagan kinsmen there\u2014yon three\r\nmost honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain the\r\ntask? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his tiara for\r\newer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, that shall bend ye\r\nto it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye\r\nharpooneers!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSilently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the detached\r\niron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs up, before him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye not\r\nthe goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance. The\r\nirons! take them; hold them while I fill!\u201d Forthwith, slowly going from\r\none officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters\r\nfrom the pewter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow\r\nthem, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha! Starbuck!\r\nbut the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it. Drink, ye\r\nharpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful whaleboat\u2019s\r\nbow\u2014Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to\r\nhis death!\u201d The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted; and to cries and\r\nmaledictions against the white whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed\r\ndown with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered. Once more, and\r\nfinally, the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when,\r\nwaving his free hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his\r\ncabin.CHAPTER XXXVII.SUNSET\n\nThe cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.\n\n\r\nI leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where\u2019er I\r\nsail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first\r\nI pass.\r\n\n\r\nYonder, by the ever-brimming goblet\u2019s rim, the warm waves blush like\r\nwine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun\u2014slow dived from\r\nnoon,\u2014goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill.\r\nIs, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? This Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is\r\nit bright with many a gem; I, the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly\r\nfeel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. \u2019Tis iron\u2014that I\r\nknow\u2014not gold. \u2019Tis split, too\u2014that I feel; the jagged edge\r\ngalls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,\r\nmine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!\r\n\n\r\nDry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so\r\nthe sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all\r\nloveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne\u2019er enjoy. Gifted with the\r\nhigh perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most\r\nmalignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night\u2014good night!\r\n(waving his hand, he moves from the window.)\r\n\n\r\n\u2019Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;\r\nbut my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they revolve.\r\nOr, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand before me;\r\nand I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match itself must needs\r\nbe wasting! What I\u2019ve dared, I\u2019ve willed; and what I\u2019ve\r\nwilled, I\u2019ll do! They think me mad\u2014Starbuck does; but I\u2019m\r\ndemoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that\u2019s only calm to\r\ncomprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered;\r\nand\u2014Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my\r\ndismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That\u2019s more\r\nthan ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players,\r\nye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I will not say as\r\nschool-boys do to bullies,\u2014Take some one of your own size; don\u2019t\r\npommel me! No, ye\u2019ve knocked me down, and I am up again; but\r\nye have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton bags! I have\r\nno long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab\u2019s compliments to ye; come and see if\r\nye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves!\r\nman has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron\r\nrails, whereon my soul is grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the\r\nrifled hearts of mountains, under torrents\u2019 beds, unerringly I rush!\r\nNaught\u2019s an obstacle, naught\u2019s an angle to the iron way!CHAPTER XXXVIII.DUSK\n\nBy the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it.\n\n\r\nMy soul is more than matched; she\u2019s overmanned; and by a madman!\r\nInsufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But he\r\ndrilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see his\r\nimpious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill I, the ineffable\r\nthing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut. Horrible\r\nold man! Who\u2019s over him, he cries;\u2014aye, he would be a democrat to\r\nall above; look, how he lords it over all below! Oh! I plainly see my miserable\r\noffice,\u2014to obey, rebelling; and worse yet, to hate with touch of pity!\r\nFor in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is\r\nthere hope. Time and tide flow wide. The hated whale has the round watery world\r\nto swim in, as the small gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting\r\npurpose, God may wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my\r\nwhole clock\u2019s run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no\r\nkey to lift again.\r\n\n\r\n[A burst of revelry from the forecastle.]\r\n\n\r\nOh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human\r\nmothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white whale is\r\ntheir demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward! mark the\r\nunfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life. Foremost through the\r\nsparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering bow, but only to drag\r\ndark Ahab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin, builded over\r\nthe dead water of the wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings.\r\nThe long howl thrills me through! Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh,\r\nlife! \u2019tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to\r\nknowledge,\u2014as wild, untutored things are forced to feed\u2014Oh, life!\r\n\u2019tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but \u2019tis not me!\r\nthat horror\u2019s out of me! and with the soft feeling of the human in me,\r\nyet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me,\r\nbind me, O ye blessed influences!CHAPTER XXXIX.FIRST NIGHT-WATCHFORE-TOP\n\r\n(Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)\r\n\n\r\nHa! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!\u2014I\u2019ve been thinking over it\r\never since, and that ha, ha\u2019s the final consequence. Why so? Because a\r\nlaugh\u2019s the wisest, easiest answer to all that\u2019s queer; and come\r\nwhat will, one comfort\u2019s always left\u2014that unfailing comfort is,\r\nit\u2019s all predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my\r\npoor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure\r\nthe old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the gift,\r\nmight readily have prophesied it\u2014for when I clapped my eye upon his skull\r\nI saw it. Well, Stubb, wise Stubb\u2014that\u2019s my\r\ntitle\u2014well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here\u2019s a carcase. I know not\r\nall that may be coming, but be it what it will, I\u2019ll go to it laughing.\r\nSuch a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la!\r\nlirra, skirra! What\u2019s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its\r\neyes out?\u2014Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay\r\nas a frigate\u2019s pennant, and so am I\u2014fa, la! lirra, skirra!\r\nOh\u2014\r\n\n\r\nWe\u2019ll drink to-night with hearts as light,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To love, as gay and fleeting\r\nAs bubbles that swim, on the beaker\u2019s brim,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And break on the lips while meeting.\r\n\n\r\nA brave stave that\u2014who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye,\r\nsir\u2014(Aside) he\u2019s my superior, he has his too, if I\u2019m\r\nnot mistaken.\u2014Aye, aye, sir, just through with this job\u2014coming.CHAPTER XL.MIDNIGHT, FORECASTLE\n\r\nHARPOONERS AND SAILORS.\r\n(Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning, and\r\nlying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus.)\r\n\n\r\nFarewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!\r\nFarewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our captain\u2019s commanded.\u2014\r\n\n\r\n1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR.\r\nOh, boys, don\u2019t be sentimental; it\u2019s bad for the digestion! Take a\r\ntonic, follow me!\r\n\n\r\n(Sings, and all follow.)\r\nOur captain stood upon the deck,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A spy-glass in his hand,\r\nA viewing of those gallant whales\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That blew at every strand.\r\nOh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And by your braces stand,\r\nAnd we\u2019ll have one of those fine whales,\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hand, boys, over hand!\r\nSo, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!\r\nWhile the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!\r\n\n\r\nMATE\u2019S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK.\r\nEight bells there, forward!\r\n\n\r\n2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR.\r\nAvast the chorus! Eight bells there! d\u2019ye hear, bell-boy? Strike the bell\r\neight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch. I\u2019ve the sort\r\nof mouth for that\u2014the hogshead mouth. So, so, (thrusts his head down\r\nthe scuttle,) Star\u2014bo\u2014l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight bells there\r\nbelow! Tumble up!\r\n\n\r\nDUTCH SAILOR.\r\nGrand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this in our old\r\nMogul\u2019s wine; it\u2019s quite as deadening to some as filliping to\r\nothers. We sing; they sleep\u2014aye, lie down there, like ground-tier butts.\r\nAt \u2019em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail \u2019em through\r\nit. Tell \u2019em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell \u2019em it\u2019s\r\nthe resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That\u2019s\r\nthe way\u2014that\u2019s it; thy throat ain\u2019t spoiled with eating\r\nAmsterdam butter.\r\n\n\r\nFRENCH SAILOR.\r\nHist, boys! let\u2019s have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket\r\nBay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by all legs! Pip! little\r\nPip! hurrah with your tambourine!\r\n\n\r\nPIP.\r\n(Sulky and sleepy.)\r\nDon\u2019t know where it is.\r\n\n\r\nFRENCH SAILOR.\r\nBeat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say; merry\u2019s the\r\nword; hurrah! Damn me, won\u2019t you dance? Form, now, Indian-file, and\r\ngallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs! Legs!\r\n\n\r\nICELAND SAILOR.\r\nI don\u2019t like your floor, maty; it\u2019s too springy to my taste.\r\nI\u2019m used to ice-floors. I\u2019m sorry to throw cold water on the\r\nsubject; but excuse me.\r\n\n\r\nMALTESE SAILOR.\r\nMe too; where\u2019s your girls? Who but a fool would take his left hand by\r\nhis right, and say to himself, how d\u2019ye do? Partners! I must have\r\npartners!\r\n\n\r\nSICILIAN SAILOR.\r\nAye; girls and a green!\u2014then I\u2019ll hop with ye; yea, turn\r\ngrasshopper!\r\n\n\r\nLONG-ISLAND SAILOR.\r\nWell, well, ye sulkies, there\u2019s plenty more of us. Hoe corn when you may,\r\nI say. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the music; now for it!\r\n\n\r\nAZORE SAILOR.\r\n(Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle.)\r\nHere you are, Pip; and there\u2019s the windlass-bitts; up you mount! Now,\r\nboys!\r\n\n\r\n(The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below; some sleep or lie\r\namong the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty.)\r\n\n\r\nAZORE SAILOR.\r\n(Dancing.)\r\nGo it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it, bell-boy; Make\r\nfire-flies; break the jinglers!\r\n\n\r\nPIP.\r\nJinglers, you say?\u2014there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.\r\n\n\r\nCHINA SAILOR.\r\nRattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.\r\n\n\r\nFRENCH SAILOR.\r\nMerry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it! split jibs! tear\r\nyourselves!\r\n\n\r\nTASHTEGO.\r\n(Quietly smoking.)\r\nThat\u2019s a white man; he calls that fun: humph! I save my sweat.\r\n\n\r\nOLD MANX SAILOR.\r\nI wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over.\r\nI\u2019ll dance over your grave, I will\u2014that\u2019s the bitterest\r\nthreat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners. O Christ! to\r\nthink of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well, well; belike the\r\nwhole world\u2019s a ball, as you scholars have it; and so \u2019tis right to\r\nmake one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you\u2019re young; I was once.\r\n\n\r\n3D NANTUCKET SAILOR.\r\nSpell oh!\u2014whew! this is worse than pulling after whales in a\r\ncalm\u2014give us a whiff, Tash.\r\n\n\r\n(They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky\r\ndarkens\u2014the wind rises.)\r\n\n\r\nLASCAR SAILOR.\r\nBy Brahma! boys, it\u2019ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born, high-tide Ganges\r\nturned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!\r\n\n\r\nMALTESE SAILOR.\r\n(Reclining and shaking his cap.)\r\nIt\u2019s the waves\u2014the snow\u2019s caps turn to jig it now.\r\nThey\u2019ll shake their tassels soon. Now would all the waves were women,\r\nthen I\u2019d go drown, and chassee with them evermore! There\u2019s naught\r\nso sweet on earth\u2014heaven may not match it!\u2014as those swift glances\r\nof warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe,\r\nbursting grapes.\r\n\n\r\nSICILIAN SAILOR.\r\n(Reclining.)\r\nTell me not of it! Hark ye, lad\u2014fleet interlacings of the\r\nlimbs\u2014lithe swayings\u2014coyings\u2014flutterings! lip! heart! hip!\r\nall graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye, else come satiety.\r\nEh, Pagan? (Nudging.)\r\n\n\r\nTAHITAN SAILOR.\r\n(Reclining on a mat.)\r\nHail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!\u2014the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low\r\nveiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has\r\nslid! I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye\r\nthence; now worn and wilted quite. Ah me!\u2014not thou nor I can bear the\r\nchange! How then, if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams\r\nfrom Pirohitee\u2019s peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown\r\nthe villages?\u2014The blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (Leaps to\r\nhis feet.)\r\n\n\r\nPORTUGUESE SAILOR.\r\nHow the sea rolls swashing \u2019gainst the side! Stand by for reefing,\r\nhearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell they\u2019ll go\r\nlunging presently.\r\n\n\r\nDANISH SAILOR.\r\nCrack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou holdest! Well done! The\r\nmate there holds ye to it stiffly. He\u2019s no more afraid than the isle fort\r\nat Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns, on which the\r\nsea-salt cakes!\r\n\n\r\n4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR.\r\nHe has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill\r\na squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a pistol\u2014fire your\r\nship right into it!\r\n\n\r\nENGLISH SAILOR.\r\nBlood! but that old man\u2019s a grand old cove! We are the lads to hunt him\r\nup his whale!\r\n\n\r\nALL.\r\nAye! aye!\r\n\n\r\nOLD MANX SAILOR.\r\nHow the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when\r\nshifted to any other soil, and here there\u2019s none but the crew\u2019s\r\ncursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather when brave\r\nhearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain has his\r\nbirth-mark; look yonder, boys, there\u2019s another in the\r\nsky\u2014lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.\r\n\n\r\nDAGGOO.\r\nWhat of that? Who\u2019s afraid of black\u2019s afraid of me! I\u2019m\r\nquarried out of it!\r\n\n\r\nSPANISH SAILOR.\r\n(Aside.) He wants to bully, ah!\u2014the old grudge makes me touchy.\r\n(Advancing.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark side of\r\nmankind\u2014devilish dark at that. No offence.\r\n\n\r\nDAGGOO (grimly).\r\nNone.\r\n\n\r\nST. JAGO\u2019S SAILOR.\r\nThat Spaniard\u2019s mad or drunk. But that can\u2019t be, or else in his one\r\ncase our old Mogul\u2019s fire-waters are somewhat long in working.\r\n\n\r\n5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR.\r\nWhat\u2019s that I saw\u2014lightning? Yes.\r\n\n\r\nSPANISH SAILOR.\r\nNo; Daggoo showing his teeth.\r\n\n\r\nDAGGOO (springing).\r\nSwallow thine, mannikin!

There! the ringed horizon. In that ring Cain struck Abel. Sweet\r\nwork, right work! No? Why then, God, mad\u2019st thou the ring?\r\n\n\r\nMATE\u2019S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK.\r\nHands by the halyards! in top-gallant sails!

Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay!\r\nBlang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal yard! It\u2019s worse\r\nthan being in the whirled woods, the last day of the year! Who\u2019d go\r\nclimbing after chestnuts now? But there they go, all cursing, and here I\r\ndon\u2019t. Fine prospects to \u2019em; they\u2019re on the road to heaven.\r\nHold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps there are worse\r\nyet\u2014they are your white squalls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr!\r\nshirr! Here have I heard all their chat just now, and the white\r\nwhale\u2014shirr! shirr!\u2014but spoken of once! and only this\r\nevening\u2014it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine\u2014that\r\nanaconda of an old man swore \u2019em in to hunt him! Oh, thou big white God\r\naloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy down\r\nhere; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!CHAPTER XLI.MOBY DICK\n\r\nI, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest; my oath\r\nhad been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more did I hammer and\r\nclinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A wild, mystical,\r\nsympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab\u2019s quenchless feud seemed mine. With\r\ngreedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and\r\nall the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge.\r\n\n\r\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded White\r\nWhale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale\r\nfishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a few of them,\r\ncomparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet had actually\r\nand knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large\r\nnumber of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the\r\nentire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest\r\nalong solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more\r\non a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort; the\r\ninordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of\r\nsailing from home; all these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect,\r\nlong obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the\r\nspecial individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be\r\ndoubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a\r\ntime, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and\r\nmalignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had\r\ncompletely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say,\r\nthat the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of\r\nlate the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent\r\ninstances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked;\r\ntherefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby\r\nDick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the\r\npeculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale\r\nfishery at large, than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the\r\ndisastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\r\nregarded.\r\n\n\r\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance caught\r\nsight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them, almost,\r\nas boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of that\r\nspecies. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults\u2014not\r\nrestricted to sprained wrists and ancles, broken limbs, or devouring\r\namputations\u2014but fatal to the last degree of fatality; those repeated\r\ndisastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick;\r\nthose things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom\r\nthe story of the White Whale had eventually come.\r\n\n\r\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify\r\nthe true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do fabulous rumors\r\nnaturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events,\u2014as\r\nthe smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than\r\nin that of terra firma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate\r\nreality for them to cling to. And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter,\r\nso the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the\r\nwonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there.\r\nFor not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and\r\nsuperstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by\r\nall odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly\r\nastonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels,\r\nbut, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that\r\nthough you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not\r\ncome to any chiselled hearthstone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of the\r\nsun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does,\r\nthe whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant\r\nwith many a mighty birth.\r\n\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the\r\nwidest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in the end\r\nincorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and half-formed f\u0153tal\r\nsuggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually invested Moby Dick with\r\nnew terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears. So that in many\r\ncases such a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those rumors, at\r\nleast, had heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to\r\nencounter the perils of his jaw.\r\n\n\r\nBut there were still other and more vital practical influences at work. Not\r\neven at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale, as\r\nfearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out of\r\nthe minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among them, who,\r\nthough intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or\r\nRight whale, would perhaps\u2014either from professional inexperience, or\r\nincompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate,\r\nthere are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\r\nsailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm\r\nWhale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble\r\nmonster primitively pursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men\r\nwill hearken with a childish fire-side interest and awe, to the wild, strange\r\ntales of Southern whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great\r\nSperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows\r\nwhich stem him.\r\n\n\r\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times\r\nthrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists\u2014Olassen and\r\nPovelson\u2014declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to\r\nevery other creature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as\r\ncontinually to be athirst for human blood. Nor even down to so late a time as\r\nCuvier\u2019s, were these or almost similar impressions effaced. For in his\r\nNatural History, the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale,\r\nall fish (sharks included) are \u201cstruck with the most lively\r\nterrors,\u201d and \u201coften in the precipitancy of their flight dash\r\nthemselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous\r\ndeath.\u201d And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such\r\nreports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item\r\nof Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\r\nvocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\r\n\n\r\nSo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of the\r\nfishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the Sperm\r\nWhale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right\r\nwhalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare; such men\r\nprotesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to\r\nchase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for\r\nmortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\r\neternity. On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\n\r\nNevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were ready\r\nto give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing only to\r\nhear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of any certain\r\ncalamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not\r\nto flee from the battle if offered.\r\n\n\r\nOne of the wild suggestings referred to, as at last coming to be linked with\r\nthe White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the unearthly\r\nconceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been encountered in\r\nopposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.\r\n\n\r\nNor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether\r\nwithout some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets of the\r\ncurrents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most erudite\r\nresearch; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface\r\nremain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time\r\nhave originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\r\nespecially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great\r\ndepth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely\r\ndistant points.\r\n\n\r\nIt is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as well\r\na thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that some\r\nwhales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been\r\nfound the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be\r\ngainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared that the\r\ninterval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many\r\ndays. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the\r\nnor\u2019 west passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to the\r\nwhale. So that here, in the real living experience of living men, the prodigies\r\nrelated in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top\r\nthere was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\r\nsurface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near\r\nSyracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an\r\nunderground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by\r\nthe realities of the whaleman.\r\n\n\r\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that\r\nafter repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive; it cannot\r\nbe much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their\r\nsuperstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for\r\nimmortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be\r\nplanted in his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he\r\nshould ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly\r\ndeception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his\r\nunsullied jet would once more be seen.\r\n\n\r\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the\r\nearthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the\r\nimagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that\r\nso much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown\r\nout\u2014a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical\r\nwhite hump. These were his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the\r\nlimitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to\r\nthose who knew him.\r\n\n\r\nThe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the same\r\nshrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation of\r\nthe White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect, when\r\nseen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of\r\ncreamy foam, all spangled with golden gleamings.\r\n\n\r\nNor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his deformed\r\nlower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror, as that\r\nunexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific accounts, he had\r\nover and over again evinced in his assaults. More than all, his treacherous\r\nretreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming\r\nbefore his exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\r\nseveral times been known to turn around suddenly, and, bearing down upon them,\r\neither stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to\r\ntheir ship.\r\n\n\r\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\r\ndisasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the\r\nfishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale\u2019s infernal\r\naforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused, was\r\nnot wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\r\n\n\r\nJudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his more\r\ndesperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats, and the\r\nsinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds of the\r\nwhale\u2019s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled\r\non, as if at a birth or a bridal.\r\n\n\r\nHis three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the eddies;\r\none captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had dashed at the\r\nwhale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a six inch\r\nblade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That captain was Ahab. And\r\nthen it was, that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him,\r\nMoby Dick had reaped away Ahab\u2019s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the\r\nfield. No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with\r\nmore seeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since\r\nthat almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against\r\nthe whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came\r\nto identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual\r\nand spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\r\nincarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in\r\nthem, till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung. That\r\nintangible malignity which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even\r\nthe modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites\r\nof the east reverenced in their statue devil;\u2014Ahab did not fall down and\r\nworship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred\r\nwhite whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most\r\nmaddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with\r\nmalice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle\r\ndemonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly\r\npersonified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the\r\nwhale\u2019s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his\r\nwhole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he\r\nburst his hot heart\u2019s shell upon it.\r\n\n\r\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the\r\nprecise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,\r\nknife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal\r\nanimosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt\r\nthe agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision\r\nforced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and\r\nanguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that\r\ndreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed\r\nsoul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only\r\nthen, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\r\nseized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the\r\npassage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital\r\nstrength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his\r\ndelirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he\r\nsailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings\r\nof the gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with\r\nmild stun\u2019sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all\r\nappearances, the old man\u2019s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape\r\nHorn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and\r\nair; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and\r\nissued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful\r\nmadness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human\r\nmadness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled,\r\nit may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab\u2019s\r\nfull lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson,\r\nwhen that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland\r\ngorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab\u2019s\r\nbroad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of\r\nhis great natural intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became\r\nthe living instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy\r\nstormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred\r\ncannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab,\r\nto that one end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had\r\nsanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.\r\n\n\r\nThis is much; yet Ahab\u2019s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\r\nBut vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far\r\ndown from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here\r\nstand\u2014however grand and wonderful, now quit it;\u2014and take your way,\r\nye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far\r\nbeneath the fantastic towers of man\u2019s upper earth, his root of grandeur,\r\nhis whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried beneath\r\nantiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken throne, the great gods\r\nmock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his\r\nfrozen brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder,\r\nsadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did\r\nbeget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old\r\nState-secret come.\r\n\n\r\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are\r\nsane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change, or\r\nshun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did now long dissemble; in\r\nsome sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his\r\nperceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he\r\nsucceed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at\r\nlast, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that\r\nto the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him.\r\n\n\r\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to\r\na kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which always afterwards,\r\nto the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on\r\nhis brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for\r\nanother whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating\r\npeople of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those\r\nvery reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so\r\nfull of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\r\nscorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea;\r\nsuch an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and\r\nlift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason\r\nthought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem\r\nsuperlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack. But\r\nbe all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his unabated\r\nrage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present\r\nvoyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.\r\nHad any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was\r\nlurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\r\nwrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable\r\ncruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent\r\non an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.\r\n\n\r\nHere, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a\r\nJob\u2019s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up\r\nof mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals\u2014morally enfeebled\r\nalso, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in\r\nStarbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb,\r\nand the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed\r\nspecially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his\r\nmonomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old\r\nman\u2019s ire\u2014by what evil magic their souls were possessed, that at\r\ntimes his hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their insufferable\r\nfoe as his; how all this came to be\u2014what the White Whale was to them, or\r\nhow to their unconscious understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he\r\nmight have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,\u2014all this\r\nto explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner\r\nthat works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever\r\nshifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm\r\ndrag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave\r\nmyself up to the abandonment of the time and the place; but while yet all\r\na-rush to encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest\r\nill.CHAPTER XLII.THE WHITENESS OF THE WHALE\n\r\nWhat the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to\r\nme, as yet remains unsaid.\r\n\n\r\nAside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could\r\nnot but occasionally awaken in any man\u2019s soul some alarm, there was\r\nanother thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at\r\ntimes by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical\r\nand well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a\r\ncomprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things\r\nappalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim,\r\nrandom way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.\r\n\n\r\nThough in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if\r\nimparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls;\r\nand though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal\r\npre-eminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing\r\nthe title \u201cLord of the White Elephants\u201d above all their other\r\nmagniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling\r\nthe same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag\r\nbearing the one figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire,\r\nC\u00e6sarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial color the same\r\nimperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race\r\nitself, giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and\r\nthough, besides all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness,\r\nfor among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other\r\nmortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many\r\ntouching, noble things\u2014the innocence of brides, the benignity of age;\r\nthough among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was\r\nthe deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the\r\nmajesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily\r\nstate of kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher\r\nmysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the\r\ndivine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white\r\nforked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,\r\nGreat Jove himself made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble\r\nIroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the\r\nholiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held\r\nthe purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of\r\ntheir own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for white, all\r\nChristian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb\r\nor tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the\r\nRomish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of\r\nour Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the\r\nredeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the\r\ngreat white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet\r\nfor all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honorable,\r\nand sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this\r\nhue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights\r\nin blood.\r\n\n\r\nThis elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when\r\ndivorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in\r\nitself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear\r\nof the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky\r\nwhiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness\r\nit is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than\r\nterrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged\r\ntiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or\r\nshark.[5]\n\n\n [5]\r\nWith reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would\r\nfain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately\r\nregarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for,\r\nanalysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only arises from the\r\ncircumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands\r\ninvested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing\r\ntogether two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us\r\nwith so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were\r\nit not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified terror.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\r\ncreature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same\r\nquality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the\r\nFrench in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead\r\nbegins with \u201cRequiem eternam\u201d (eternal rest), whence Requiem\r\ndenominating the mass itself, and any other funereal music. Now, in allusion to\r\nthe white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of\r\nhis habits, the French call him Requin.\r\n\n\r\nBethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment\r\nand pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations? Not\r\nColeridge first threw that spell; but God\u2019s great, unflattering laureate,\r\nNature.[6]\n\n\n [6]\r\nI remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in\r\nwaters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended\r\nto the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a\r\nregal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill\r\nsublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to\r\nembrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though\r\nbodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king\u2019s ghost in supernatural\r\ndistress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to\r\nsecrets which took hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself;\r\nthe white thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled\r\nwaters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns.\r\nLong I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the\r\nthings that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a\r\nsailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! I never had heard that\r\nname before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to\r\nmen ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some\r\nseaman\u2019s name for albatross. So that by no possibility could\r\nColeridge\u2019s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical\r\nimpressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither\r\nhad I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying\r\nthis, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem\r\nand the poet.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly\r\nlurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a\r\nsolecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I have\r\nfrequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic\r\nfowl.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell;\r\nwith a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last the\r\nCaptain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round its neck,\r\nwith the ship\u2019s time and place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt\r\nnot, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the\r\nwhite fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!\r\n\n\r\nMost famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White\r\nSteed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed,\r\nsmall-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his\r\nlofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild\r\nhorses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains\r\nand the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that\r\nchosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing\r\ncascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings\r\nmore resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A most\r\nimperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western world, which to\r\nthe eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval\r\ntimes when Adam walked majestic as a god, bluff-bowed and fearless as this\r\nmighty steed. Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of\r\ncountless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or\r\nwhether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the\r\nWhite Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his\r\ncool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest\r\nIndians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be\r\nquestioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that it\r\nwas his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and\r\nthat this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at the\r\nsame time enforced a certain nameless terror.\r\n\n\r\nBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and\r\nstrange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross.\r\n\n\r\nWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the\r\neye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is that\r\nwhiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears. The Albino\r\nis as well made as other men\u2014has no substantive deformity\u2014and yet\r\nthis mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous\r\nthan the ugliest abortion. Why should this be so?\r\n\n\r\nNor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the less\r\nmalicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of\r\nthe terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas\r\nhas been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the\r\nart of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the\r\neffect of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\r\nfaction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the\r\nmarket-place!\r\n\n\r\nNor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind fail\r\nto bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be doubted,\r\nthat the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the\r\ngazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as\r\nmuch like the badge of consternation in the other world, as of mortal\r\ntrepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive\r\nhue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we\r\nfail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a\r\nmilk-white fog\u2014Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even\r\nthe king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid\r\nhorse.\r\n\n\r\nTherefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he\r\nwill by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized\r\nsignificance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.\r\n\n\r\nBut though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to account\r\nfor it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the citation of\r\nsome of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness\u2014though for the\r\ntime either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations\r\ncalculated to impart to it aught fearful, but, nevertheless, is found to exert\r\nover us the same sorcery, however modified;\u2014can we thus hope to light\r\nupon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?\r\n\n\r\nLet us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and\r\nwithout imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And though,\r\ndoubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented\r\nmay have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of\r\nthem at the time, and therefore may not be able to recall them now.\r\n\n\r\nWhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely acquainted\r\nwith the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention of Whitsuntide\r\nmarshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless processions of slow-pacing\r\npilgrims, downcast and hooded with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread,\r\nunsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States, why does the passing\r\nmention of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the\r\nsoul?\r\n\n\r\nOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings\r\n(which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of London\r\ntell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American, than\r\nthose other storied structures, its neighbors\u2014the Byward Tower, or even\r\nthe Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire,\r\nwhence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the\r\nbare mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge is\r\nfull of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes\r\nand longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over\r\nthe fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long\r\nlacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet\r\nsleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely\r\naddressed to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,\r\ndoes the tall pale man of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor\r\nunrestingly glides through the green of the groves\u2014why is this phantom\r\nmore terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?\r\n\n\r\nNor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes;\r\nnor the stampedoes of her frantic seas: nor the tearlessness of arid skies that\r\nnever rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched\r\ncope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and\r\nher suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed\r\npack of cards;\u2014it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the\r\nstrangest, saddest city thou can\u2019st see. For Lima has taken the white\r\nveil; and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as\r\nPizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful\r\ngreenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor\r\nof an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.\r\n\n\r\nI know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is not\r\nconfessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise\r\nterrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those\r\nappearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one\r\nphenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to\r\nmuteness or universality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be\r\nrespectively elucidated by the following examples.\r\n\n\r\nFirst: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by night\r\nhe hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just enough of\r\ntrepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely similar\r\ncircumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing\r\nthrough a midnight sea of milky whiteness\u2014as if from encircling headlands\r\nshoals of combed white bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent,\r\nsuperstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to\r\nhim as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings;\r\nheart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him\r\nagain. Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, \u201cSir, it was not so\r\nmuch the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness\r\nthat so stirred me?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSecond: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the snow-howdahed\r\nAndes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere fancying of the\r\neternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural\r\nconceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman\r\nsolitudes. Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with\r\ncomparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow,\r\nno shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the\r\nsailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some\r\ninfernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and\r\nhalf shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,\r\nviews what seems a boundless church-yard grinning upon him with its lean ice\r\nmonuments and splintered crosses.\r\n\n\r\nBut thou sayest, methinks this white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a\r\nwhite flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.\r\n\n\r\nTell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont,\r\nfar removed from all beasts of prey\u2014why is it that upon the sunniest day,\r\nif you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot even see\r\nit, but only smells its wild animal muskiness\u2014why will he start, snort,\r\nand with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright? There is no\r\nremembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home,\r\nso that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything\r\nassociated with the experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New\r\nEngland colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?\r\n\n\r\nNo: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the knowledge\r\nof the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from Oregon, still when\r\nhe smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as present as\r\nto the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant they may be\r\ntrampling into dust.\r\n\n\r\nThus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of the\r\nfestooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of\r\nprairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the\r\nfrightened colt!\r\n\n\r\nThough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign\r\ngives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere those things\r\nmust exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in\r\nlove, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.\r\n\n\r\nBut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned why\r\nit appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more\r\nportentous\u2014why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning symbol of\r\nspiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian\u2019s Deity; and yet\r\nshould be as it is, the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to\r\nmankind.\r\n\n\r\nIs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and\r\nimmensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of\r\nannihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that\r\nas in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color,\r\nand at the same time the concrete of all colors; is it for these reasons that\r\nthere is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of\r\nsnows\u2014a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink? And when we\r\nconsider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly\r\nhues\u2014every stately or lovely emblazoning\u2014the sweet tinges of sunset\r\nskies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly\r\ncheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent\r\nin substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature\r\nabsolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the\r\ncharnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the\r\nmystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle of\r\nlight, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without\r\nmedium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its\r\nown blank tinge\u2014pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a\r\nleper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear colored and\r\ncoloring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind\r\nat the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of\r\nall these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery\r\nhunt?CHAPTER XLIII.HARK!\n\r\n\u201cHist! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a\r\ncordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the\r\nscuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets to fill\r\nthe scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the\r\nquarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet. From hand to\r\nhand, the buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the occasional\r\nflap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.\r\n\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose post\r\nwas near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the words\r\nabove.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d\u2019ye mean?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere it is again\u2014under the hatches\u2014don\u2019t you hear\r\nit\u2014a cough\u2014it sounded like a cough.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere again\u2014there it is!\u2014it sounds like two or three\r\nsleepers turning over, now!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It\u2019s the three soaked\r\nbiscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye\u2014nothing else. Look\r\nto the bucket!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSay what ye will, shipmate; I\u2019ve sharp ears.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, you are the chap, ain\u2019t ye, that heard the hum of the old\r\nQuakeress\u2019s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;\r\nyou\u2019re the chap.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGrin away; we\u2019ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is\r\nsomebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I\r\nsuspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one\r\nmorning watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTish! the bucket!\u201dCHAPTER XLIV.THE CHART\n\r\nHad you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took\r\nplace on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his\r\ncrew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and bringing out a\r\nlarge wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them before him on his\r\nscrewed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you would have seen him\r\nintently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with\r\nslow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were\r\nblank. At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him,\r\nwherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former\r\nvoyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.\r\n\n\r\nWhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head,\r\ncontinually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw shifting\r\ngleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that\r\nwhile he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some\r\ninvisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked\r\nchart of his forehead.\r\n\n\r\nBut it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his cabin,\r\nAhab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were brought out;\r\nalmost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others were substituted.\r\nFor with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading a maze of\r\ncurrents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that\r\nmonomaniac thought of his soul.\r\n\n\r\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it might\r\nseem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the\r\nunhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the\r\nsets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of the\r\nsperm whale\u2019s food; and, also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained\r\nseasons for hunting him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable\r\nsurmises, almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be\r\nupon this or that ground in search of his prey.\r\n\n\r\nSo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm\r\nwhale\u2019s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could\r\nhe be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for one\r\nvoyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the\r\nsperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the\r\nherring-shoals or the flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been\r\nmade to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.[7]\n\n\n [7]\r\nSince the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by an official\r\ncircular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National Observatory, Washington,\r\nApril 16th, 1851. By that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is\r\nin course of completion; and portions of it are presented in the circular. This\r\nchart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five\r\ndegrees of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\r\ntwelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which\r\ndistricts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have been spent\r\nin each month in every district, and the two others to show the number of days\r\nin which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.\r\n\n\r\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the sperm\r\nwhales, guided by some infallible instinct\u2014say, rather, secret\r\nintelligence from the Deity\u2014mostly swim in veins, as they are\r\ncalled; continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating\r\nexactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one tithe\r\nof such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the direction taken by\r\nany one whale be straight as a surveyor\u2019s parallel, and though the line\r\nof advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the\r\narbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces\r\nsome few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or\r\ncontract); but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship\u2019s\r\nmast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that\r\nat particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating whales\r\nmay with great confidence be looked for. \n\r\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\r\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing the\r\nwidest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place\r\nand time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospect of\r\na meeting.\r\n\n\r\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious\r\nbut still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps. Though the\r\ngregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet\r\nin general you cannot conclude that the herds which hunted such and such a\r\nlatitude or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same\r\nwith those that were found there the preceding season; though there are\r\npeculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\r\ntrue. In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to\r\nthe solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though\r\nMoby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the\r\nSeychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet\r\nit did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any\r\nsubsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So,\r\ntoo, with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.\r\nBut all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to\r\nspeak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab\u2019s chances of\r\naccomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been\r\nmade to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\r\nparticular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become\r\nprobabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to\r\na certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one\r\ntechnical phrase\u2014the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several\r\nconsecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those\r\nwaters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\r\ninterval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the\r\ndeadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\r\nstoried with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac\r\nold man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious\r\ncomprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding\r\nsoul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his\r\nhopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might\r\nbe to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize\r\nhis unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\r\n\n\r\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\r\nSeason-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to\r\nmake the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running down\r\nsixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise\r\nthere. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature\r\nhour of the Pequod\u2019s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by\r\nAhab, with a view to this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which,\r\ninstead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;\r\nif by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his\r\nperiodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian\r\nGulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by\r\nhis race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind\r\nbut the Levanter and Simoom, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\r\nworld-circle of the Pequod\u2019s circumnavigating wake.\r\n\n\r\nBut granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not but a\r\nmad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if\r\nencountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his\r\nhunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of\r\nConstantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his\r\nsnow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the\r\nwhale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long\r\nafter midnight he would throw himself back in reveries\u2014tallied him, and\r\nshall he escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost\r\nsheep\u2019s ear! And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race;\r\ntill a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air\r\nof the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of\r\ntorments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful\r\ndesire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in\r\nhis palms.\r\n\n\r\nOften, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams\r\nof the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the day, carried\r\nthem on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round and round in his\r\nblazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became insufferable\r\nanguish; and when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him\r\nheaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from\r\nwhich forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to\r\nleap down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry\r\nwould be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from\r\nhis state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these,\r\nperhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness,\r\nor fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity.\r\nFor, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of\r\nthe white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that\r\nso caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal,\r\nliving principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated\r\nfrom the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer\r\nvehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity\r\nof the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an integral. But\r\nas the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul, therefore it must have\r\nbeen that, in Ahab\u2019s case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to\r\nhis one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will,\r\nforced itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent\r\nbeing of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to\r\nwhich it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered\r\nbirth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when\r\nwhat seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a\r\nformless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure, but without\r\nan object to color, and therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old\r\nman, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense\r\nthinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever;\r\nthat vulture the very creature he creates.CHAPTER XLV.THE AFFIDAVIT\n\r\nSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as\r\nindirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the\r\nhabits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earliest part, is as\r\nimportant a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter of it\r\nrequires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be\r\nadequately understood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a\r\nprofound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the\r\nnatural verity of the main points of this affair.\r\n\n\r\nI care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be content\r\nto produce the desired impression by separate citations of items, practically\r\nor reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these citations, I take\r\nit\u2014the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself.\r\n\n\r\nFirst: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a\r\nharpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an interval (in one\r\ninstance of three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain;\r\nwhen the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken\r\nfrom the body. In the instance where three years intervened between the\r\nflinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may have been something more than\r\nthat; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading\r\nship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and\r\npenetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two\r\nyears, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with\r\nall the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown\r\nregions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels;\r\nno doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all\r\nthe coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came\r\ntogether, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three\r\ninstances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and,\r\nupon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in\r\nthem, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so\r\nfell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time\r\ndistinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale\u2019s eye,\r\nwhich I had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I am\r\npretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances, then, which I\r\npersonally know the truth of; but I have heard of many other instances from\r\npersons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant the\r\nworld ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable historical\r\ninstances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and\r\nplaces popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became thus marked was not\r\naltogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished\r\nfrom other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may\r\nbe, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him\r\ndown into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the\r\nfatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness\r\nabout such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most\r\nfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins\r\nwhen he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to\r\ncultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that\r\nhappen to know an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive\r\nsalutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance\r\nfurther, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.\r\n\n\r\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\r\ncelebrity\u2014nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he\r\nfamous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but he\r\nwas admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a name; had\r\nas much a name indeed as Cambyses or C\u00e6sar. Was it not so, O Timor Tom! thou\r\nfamed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long did\u2019st lurk in the\r\nOriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of\r\nOmbay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that\r\ncrossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O\r\nMorquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance\r\nof a snow-white cross against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou\r\nChilian whale, marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the\r\nback! In plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of\r\nCetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.\r\n\n\r\nBut this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various times\r\ncreating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were finally gone in\r\nquest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by valiant whaling\r\ncaptains, who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view,\r\nas in setting out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it\r\nin his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost\r\nwarrior of the Indian King Philip.\r\n\n\r\nI do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make mention\r\nof one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in printed form\r\nestablishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White\r\nWhale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one of those disheartening\r\ninstances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error. So ignorant\r\nare most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the\r\nworld, that without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and\r\notherwise, of the fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable,\r\nor still worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\r\n\n\r\nFirst: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of\r\nthe grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid conception of\r\nthose perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One reason perhaps is,\r\nthat not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the\r\nfishery, ever finds a public record at home, however transient and immediately\r\nforgotten that record. Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this\r\nmoment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being\r\ncarried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan\u2014do you\r\nsuppose that that poor fellow\u2019s name will appear in the newspaper\r\nobituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are\r\nvery irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what\r\nmight be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you\r\nthat upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others\r\nwe spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale,\r\nsome of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat\u2019s crew.\r\nFor God\u2019s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon\r\nyou burn, but at least one drop of man\u2019s blood was spilled for it.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an\r\nenormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when narrating\r\nto them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness, they have\r\nsignificantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I declare upon my\r\nsoul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the\r\nhistory of the plagues of Egypt.\r\n\n\r\nBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony\r\nentirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm Whale is in some\r\ncases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously malicious, as with direct\r\naforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is\r\nmore, the Sperm Whale has done it.\r\n\n\r\nFirst: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was\r\ncruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and\r\ngave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales were\r\nwounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued\r\nfrom the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his forehead\r\nagainst her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than \u201cten\r\nminutes\u201d she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has\r\nbeen seen since. After the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land\r\nin their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed\r\nfor the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again\r\nupon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost,\r\nand forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day\r\nCaptain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was\r\nchief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and\r\nfaithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this within a few\r\nmiles of the scene of the catastrophe.[8]\n\n\n [8]\r\nThe following are extracts from Chace\u2019s narrative: \u201cEvery fact\r\nseemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which\r\ndirected his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short\r\ninterval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were\r\ncalculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby combining\r\nthe speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the exact\r\nman\u0153uvres which he made were necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such\r\nas indicated resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had\r\njust before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as if\r\nfired with revenge for their sufferings.\u201d Again: \u201cAt all events,\r\nthe whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and\r\nproducing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating\r\nmischief, on the part of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now\r\nrecall), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black\r\nnight in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore.\r\n\u201cThe dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of being\r\nswallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks, with all\r\nthe other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled\r\nto a moment\u2019s thought; the dismal looking wreck, and the horrid aspect\r\nand revenge of the whale, wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again\r\nmade its appearance.\u201d\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In another place\u2014p. 45,\u2014he speaks of \u201cthe mysterious\r\nand mortal attack of the animal\u201d.\r\n\n\r\nSecondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally lost\r\noff the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of this\r\ncatastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale hunters I\r\nhave now and then heard casual allusions to it.\r\n\n\r\nThirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J\u2014\u2014 then\r\ncommanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be dining\r\nwith a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of\r\nOahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was\r\npleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the\r\nprofessional gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that any\r\nwhale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as\r\na thimbleful. Very good; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the\r\ncommodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped\r\non the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments\u2019\r\nconfidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the\r\nCommodore\u2019s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made\r\nstraight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious,\r\nbut I consider the Commodore\u2019s interview with that whale as providential.\r\nWas not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you,\r\nthe sperm whale will stand no nonsense.\r\n\n\r\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff\u2019s Voyages for a little circumstance in\r\npoint, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must know\r\nby the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern\u2019s famous\r\nDiscovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain\r\nLangsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we\r\nwere out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very clear and\r\nfine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing.\r\nFor some days we had very little wind; it was not till the nineteenth that a\r\nbrisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommon large whale, the body of\r\nwhich was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water,\r\nbut was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which\r\nwas in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its\r\nstriking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this\r\ngigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out\r\nof the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who\r\nwere below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\r\nupon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost\r\ngravity and solemnity. Captain D\u2019Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to\r\nexamine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock, but\r\nwe found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow, the captain D\u2019Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in\r\nquestion, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures as a\r\nsea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston. I have\r\nthe honor of being a nephew of his. I have particularly questioned him\r\nconcerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates every word. The ship,\r\nhowever, was by no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian\r\ncoast, and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he\r\nsailed from home.\r\n\n\r\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too, of\r\nhonest wonders\u2014the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier\u2019s\r\nold chums\u2014I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from\r\nLangsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative\r\nexample, if such be needed.\r\n\n\r\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to \u201cJohn Ferdinando,\u201d as he calls\r\nthe modern Juan Fernandes. \u201cIn our way thither,\u201d he says,\r\n\u201cabout four o\u2019clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred\r\nand fifty leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock,\r\nwhich put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they\r\nwere or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed,\r\nthe shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had\r\nstruck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the\r\nlead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * *\r\nThe suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and several\r\nof the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his\r\nhead on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!\u201d Lionel then goes on to\r\nimpute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by\r\nstating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do\r\ngreat mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\r\ndarkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused by\r\nan unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.\r\n\n\r\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of\r\nthe great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more than one\r\ninstance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to\r\ntheir ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances\r\nhurled at him from its decks. The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on\r\nthat head; and, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been examples\r\nwhere the lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\r\ntransferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her great hull\r\nthrough the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often\r\nobserved that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he\r\nthen acts, not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\r\ndestruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\r\nindication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open\r\nhis mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive\r\nminutes. But I must be content with only one more and a concluding\r\nillustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail\r\nto see, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by\r\nplain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels) are\r\nmere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say amen with\r\nSolomon\u2014Verily there is nothing new under the sun.\r\n\n\r\nIn the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of\r\nConstantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general.\r\nAs many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every way of\r\nuncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been considered a most\r\ntrustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two\r\nparticulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\r\n\n\r\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of his\r\nprefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the\r\nneighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at\r\nintervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact thus\r\nset down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any\r\nreason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster was, is not\r\nmentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must\r\nhave been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I\r\nwill tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been\r\nalways unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it.\r\nEven now I am certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\r\npresent constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious resort. But\r\nfurther investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there\r\nhave been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the\r\nMediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a\r\nCommodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now,\r\nas a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale\r\ncould, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\r\n\n\r\nIn the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called\r\nbrit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have every\r\nreason to believe that the food of the sperm whale\u2014squid or\r\ncuttle-fish\u2014lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but\r\nby no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its surface. If, then,\r\nyou properly put these statements together, and reason upon them a bit, you\r\nwill clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning, Procopius\u2019s\r\nsea-monster, that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must\r\nin all probability have been a sperm whale.CHAPTER XLVI.SURMISES\n\r\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his thoughts and\r\nactions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick; though he seemed\r\nready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion; nevertheless it\r\nmay have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a\r\nfiery whaleman\u2019s ways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution\r\nof the voyage. Or at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other\r\nmotives much more influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps,\r\neven considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\r\nWhite Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm\r\nwhales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied\r\nthe chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the\r\nhated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there\r\nwere still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according\r\nwith the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of\r\nswaying him.\r\n\n\r\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the\r\nshadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for example,\r\nthat however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck, yet\r\nthat ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere\r\ncorporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely\r\nspiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.\r\nStarbuck\u2019s body and Starbuck\u2019s coerced will were Ahab\u2019s, so\r\nlong as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck\u2019s brain; still he knew that for\r\nall this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain\u2019s quest, and\r\ncould he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It\r\nmight be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During\r\nthat long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of\r\nrebellion against his captain\u2019s leadership, unless some ordinary,\r\nprudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only\r\nthat, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more\r\nsignificantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in\r\nforeseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of\r\nthat strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full\r\nterror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background (for\r\nfew men\u2019s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by\r\naction); that when they stood their long night watches, his officers and men\r\nmust have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly\r\nand impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet\r\nall sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable\u2014they\r\nlive in the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness\u2014and\r\nwhen retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however\r\npromissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things requisite\r\nthat temporary interests and employment should intervene and hold them\r\nhealthily suspended for the final dash.\r\n\n\r\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion mankind\r\ndisdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent. The permanent\r\nconstitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.\r\nGranting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew,\r\nand playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\r\nknight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give chase to\r\nMoby Dick, they must also have food for their more common, daily appetites. For\r\neven the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to\r\ntraverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\r\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by\r\nthe way. Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic\r\nobject\u2014that final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in\r\ndisgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of\r\ncash\u2014aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and\r\nno perspective promise of it to them, and then this same quiescent cash all at\r\nonce mutinying in them, this same cash would soon cashier Ahab.\r\n\n\r\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab\r\npersonally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat\r\nprematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod\u2019s\r\nvoyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly\r\nlaid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect\r\nimpunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end\r\ncompetent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently wrest\r\nfrom him the command. From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and\r\nthe possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab\r\nmust of course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection could\r\nonly consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a\r\nheedful, closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence\r\nwhich it was possible for his crew to be subjected to.\r\n\n\r\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally\r\ndeveloped here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue\r\ntrue to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod\u2019s voyage; observe all\r\ncustomary usages; and not only that, but force himself to evince all his well\r\nknown passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession.\r\n\n\r\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\r\nmast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\r\nreporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.CHAPTER XLVII.THE MAT-MAKER\n\r\nIt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about the\r\ndecks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-colored waters. Queequeg and I\r\nwere mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an additional\r\nlashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the\r\nscene, and such an incantation of revery lurked in the air, that each silent\r\nsailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self.\r\n\n\r\nI was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept\r\npassing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of\r\nthe warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing\r\nsideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and\r\nidly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every\r\nyarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and\r\nall over the sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that\r\nit seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle\r\nmechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads\r\nof the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration,\r\nand that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of\r\nother threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I,\r\nwith my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these\r\nunalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg\u2019s impulsive, indifferent sword,\r\nsometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as\r\nthe case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a\r\ncorresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this\r\nsavage\u2019s sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both\r\nwarp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance\u2014aye, chance,\r\nfree will, and necessity\u2014no wise incompatible\u2014all interweavingly\r\nworking together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its\r\nultimate course\u2014its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to\r\nthat; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and\r\nchance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and\r\nsideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by\r\nboth, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at events.\r\n\n Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound\r\nso strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of free\r\nwill dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that\r\nvoice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad\r\nGay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched\r\nout like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries. To be\r\nsure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas,\r\nfrom hundreds of whalemen\u2019s look-outs perched as high in the air; but\r\nfrom few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a\r\nmarvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian\u2019s.\r\n\n\r\nAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly\r\npeering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or seer\r\nbeholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing their coming.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere-away?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nInstantly all was commotion.\r\n\n\r\nThe Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and reliable\r\nuniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his\r\ngenus.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere go flukes!\u201d was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuick, steward!\u201d cried Ahab. \u201cTime! time!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact minute to\r\nAhab.\r\n\n\r\nThe ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling before\r\nit. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we\r\nconfidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows. For that\r\nsingular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head\r\nin one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills\r\nround, and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter\u2014this deceitfulness\r\nof his could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that the\r\nfish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our\r\nvicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers\u2014that is, those not\r\nappointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head.\r\nThe sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in\r\ntheir places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the\r\nthree boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs.\r\nOutside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail,\r\nwhile one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of\r\nman-of-war\u2019s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy\u2019s\r\nship.\r\n\n\r\nBut at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye\r\nfrom the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by\r\nfive dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.CHAPTER XLVIII.THE FIRST LOWERING\n\r\nThe phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of the\r\ndeck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles and bands\r\nof the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed one of the\r\nspare boats, though technically called the captain\u2019s, on account of its\r\nhanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now stood by its bows was\r\ntall and swart, with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like\r\nlips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with\r\nwide black trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning his ebonness\r\nwas a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled round\r\nand round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure\r\nwere of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal\r\nnatives of the Manillas;\u2014a race notorious for a certain diabolism of\r\nsubtilty, and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and\r\nsecret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose\r\ncounting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.\r\n\n\r\nWhile yet the wondering ship\u2019s company were gazing upon these strangers,\r\nAhab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, \u201cAll ready\r\nthere, Fedallah?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cReady,\u201d was the half-hissed reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLower away then; d\u2019ye hear?\u201d shouting across the deck.\r\n\u201cLower away there, I say.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSuch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men sprang\r\nover the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a wallow, the\r\nthree boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous, off-handed daring,\r\nunknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling\r\nship\u2019s side into the tossed boats below.\r\n\n\r\nHardly had they pulled out from under the ship\u2019s lee, when a fourth keel,\r\ncoming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed the\r\nfive strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed\r\nStarbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large\r\nexpanse of water. But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah\r\nand his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Ahab?\u201d\u2014said Starbuck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpread yourselves,\u201d cried Ahab; \u201cgive way, all four boats.\r\nThou, Flask, pull out more to leeward!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round\r\nhis great steering oar. \u201cLay back!\u201d addressing his crew.\r\n\u201cThere!\u2014there!\u2014there again! There she blows right ahead,\r\nboys!\u2014lay back!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind \u2019em, sir,\u201d said Archy; \u201cI knew\r\nit all before now. Didn\u2019t I hear \u2019em in the hold? And didn\u2019t\r\nI tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr.\r\nFlask.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\r\nones,\u201d drawingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom\r\nstill showed signs of uneasiness. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you break your\r\nbackbones, my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut!\r\nThey are only five more hands come to help us\u2014never mind from\r\nwhere\u2014the more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the\r\nbrimstone\u2014devils are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now;\r\nthat\u2019s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that\u2019s the stroke to sweep\r\nthe stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers,\r\nmen\u2014all hearts alive! Easy, easy; don\u2019t be in a\r\nhurry\u2014don\u2019t be in a hurry. Why don\u2019t you snap your oars, you\r\nrascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so, then;\u2014softly, softly!\r\nThat\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s it! long and strong. Give way there, give\r\nway! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop\r\nsnoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can\u2019t ye? pull,\r\nwon\u2019t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don\u2019t ye\r\npull?\u2014pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!\r\nHere!\u201d whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; \u201cevery\r\nmother\u2019s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his\r\nteeth. That\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s it. Now ye do something; that looks\r\nlike it, my steel-bits. Start her\u2014start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,\r\nmarling-spikes!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nStubb\u2019s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had\r\nrather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in\r\ninculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this specimen\r\nof his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his\r\ncongregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity. He would\r\nsay the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of\r\nfun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun,\r\nthat no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear\r\nlife, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time\r\nlooked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar,\r\nand so broadly gaped\u2014open-mouthed at times\u2014that the mere sight of\r\nsuch a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon\r\nthe crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose\r\njollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their\r\nguard in the matter of obeying them.\r\n\n\r\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across\r\nStubb\u2019s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near\r\nto each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye\r\nplease!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHalloa!\u201d returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\r\nspoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set like a\r\nflint from Stubb\u2019s.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat think ye of those yellow boys, sir!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSmuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,\r\nboys!\u201d) in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: \u201cA\r\nsad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind, Mr.\r\nStubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what will.\r\n(Spring, my men, spring!) There\u2019s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb,\r\nand that\u2019s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm\u2019s the\r\nplay! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye, I thought as much,\u201d soliloquized Stubb, when the boats\r\ndiverged, \u201cas soon as I clapt eye on \u2019em, I thought so. Aye, and\r\nthat\u2019s what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long\r\nsuspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale\u2019s at the bottom\r\nof it. Well, well, so be it! Can\u2019t be helped! All right! Give way, men!\r\nIt ain\u2019t the White Whale to-day! Give way!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the\r\nlowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably awakened a sort\r\nof superstitious amazement in some of the ship\u2019s company; but\r\nArchy\u2019s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among\r\nthem, though indeed not credited then, this had in some small measure prepared\r\nthem for the event. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what\r\nwith all this and Stubb\u2019s confident way of accounting for their\r\nappearance, they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings; though\r\nthe affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to\r\ndark Ahab\u2019s precise agency in the matter from the beginning. For me, I\r\nsilently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the\r\nPequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of\r\nthe unaccountable Elijah.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest to\r\nwindward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance bespeaking\r\nhow potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed\r\nall steel and whale-bone; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with\r\nregular strokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along the\r\nwater like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for\r\nFedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his\r\nblack jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body\r\nabove the gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the\r\nwatery horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a\r\nfencer\u2019s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any\r\ntendency to trip: Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a\r\nthousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All at once the\r\nout-stretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed, while the\r\nboat\u2019s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat\r\nmotionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on\r\ntheir way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus\r\ngiving no distantly discernible token of the movement, though from his closer\r\nvicinity Ahab had observed it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEvery man look out along his oars!\u201d cried Starbuck. \u201cThou,\r\nQueequeg, stand up!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage stood\r\nerect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the\r\nchase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where\r\nit was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself\r\nwas seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his\r\nchip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\r\n\n\r\nNot very far distant Flask\u2019s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its\r\ncommander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort of\r\npost rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of the stern\r\nplatform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its top is not\r\nmore spacious than the palm of a man\u2019s hand, and standing upon such a\r\nbase as that, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk\r\nto all but her trucks. But little King-Post was small and short, and at the\r\nsame time little King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this\r\nloggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on\r\nto that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUpon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way, swiftly\r\nslid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a\r\npedestal.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you\r\nfifty feet taller.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat, the\r\ngigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to Flask\u2019s\r\nfoot, and then putting Flask\u2019s hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding\r\nhim spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling landed the\r\nlittle man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was Flask now standing,\r\nDaggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breast-band to lean against\r\nand steady himself by.\r\n\n\r\nAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\r\nhabitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in\r\nhis boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and\r\ncross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the\r\nloggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask\r\nmounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with\r\na cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to\r\nevery roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back,\r\nflaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the\r\nrider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now\r\nand then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to\r\nthe negro\u2019s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the\r\nliving magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons\r\nfor that.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes. The\r\nwhales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary dive\r\nfrom mere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases,\r\nit seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe. He\r\nwithdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He\r\nloaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he\r\nignited his match across the rough sand-paper of his hand, when Tashtego, his\r\nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars,\r\nsuddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in\r\na quick phrensy of hurry, \u201cDown, down all, and give way!\u2014there they\r\nare!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been visible at\r\nthat moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water, and thin\r\nscattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing off to\r\nleeward, like the confused scud from white rolling billows. The air around\r\nsuddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were, like the air over intensely heated\r\nplates of iron. Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially\r\nbeneath a thin layer of water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance\r\nof all the other indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their\r\nforerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.\r\n\n\r\nAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and\r\nair. But it bade far to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass of\r\ninterblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPull, pull, my good boys,\u201d said Starbuck, in the lowest possible\r\nbut intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\r\nfrom his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible\r\nneedles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to his crew,\r\nthough, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the silence of the boat was\r\nat intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh\r\nwith command, now soft with entreaty.\r\n\n\r\nHow different the loud little King-Post. \u201cSing out and say something, my\r\nhearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their black\r\nbacks, boys; only do that for me, and I\u2019ll sign over to you my\r\nMartha\u2019s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys.\r\nLay me on\u2014lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad:\r\nSee! see that white water!\u201d And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his\r\nhead, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far off\r\nupon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat\u2019s\r\nstern like a crazed colt from the prairie.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook at that chap now,\u201d philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with\r\nhis unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short\r\ndistance, followed after\u2014\u201cHe\u2019s got fits, that Flask has.\r\nFits? yes, give him fits\u2014that\u2019s the very word\u2014pitch fits into\r\n\u2019em. Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you\r\nknow;\u2014merry\u2019s the word. Pull, babes\u2014pull,\r\nsucklings\u2014pull, all. But what the devil are you hurrying about? Softly,\r\nsoftly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack\r\nall your backbones, and bite your knives in two\u2014that\u2019s all. Take it\r\neasy\u2014why don\u2019t ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers\r\nand lungs!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\r\nhis\u2014these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed\r\nlight of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas\r\nmay give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of red murder,\r\nand foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask to\r\n\u201cthat whale,\u201d as he called the fictitious monster which he declared\r\nto be incessantly tantalizing his boat\u2019s bow with its tail\u2014these\r\nallusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they would cause\r\nsome one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder. But this\r\nwas against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer\r\nthrough their necks; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears,\r\nand no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the omnipotent\r\nsea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along the eight\r\ngunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the brief suspended\r\nagony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the\r\nsharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden\r\nprofound dip into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings\r\nto gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its\r\nother side;\u2014all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers,\r\nand the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory\r\nPequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen\r\nafter her screaming brood;\u2014all this was thrilling. Not the raw recruit,\r\nmarching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle;\r\nnot the dead man\u2019s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the\r\nother world;\u2014neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions\r\nthan that man does, who for the first time finds himself pulling into the\r\ncharmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm whale.\r\n\n\r\nThe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more\r\nvisible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon\r\nthe sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right\r\nand left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats were pulled more\r\napart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward. Our sail\r\nwas now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going\r\nwith such madness through the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked\r\nrapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks.\r\n\n\r\nSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship nor\r\nboat to be seen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive way, men,\u201d whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the\r\nsheet of his sail; \u201cthere is time to kill a fish yet before the squall\r\ncomes. There\u2019s white water again!\u2014close to! Spring!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSoon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the\r\nother boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a\r\nlightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: \u201cStand up!\u201d and\r\nQueequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.\r\n\n\r\nThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close\r\nto them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in\r\nthe stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had come; they\r\nheard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their\r\nlitter. Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist, the waves\r\ncurling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s his hump. There, there, give it to him!\u201d\r\nwhispered Starbuck.\r\n\n\r\nA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\r\nQueequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern,\r\nwhile forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail collapsed and\r\nexploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by; something rolled and\r\ntumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew were half suffocated as\r\nthey were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall.\r\nSquall, whale, and harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely\r\ngrazed by the iron, escaped.\r\n\n\r\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it we\r\npicked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale, tumbled back\r\nto our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water covering\r\nevery rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft\r\nseemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean.\r\n\n\r\nThe wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together; the\r\nwhole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire upon the\r\nprairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these jaws of\r\ndeath! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live coals down\r\nthe chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm. Meanwhile\r\nthe driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night; no\r\nsign of the ship could be seen. The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out\r\nthe boat. The oars were useless as propellers, performing now the office of\r\nlife-preservers. So, cutting the lashing of the water-proof match keg, after\r\nmany failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then\r\nstretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of\r\nthis forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the\r\nheart of that almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of\r\na man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.\r\n\n\r\nWet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we\r\nlifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the sea, the\r\nempty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly Queequeg started\r\nto his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard a faint creaking, as\r\nof ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The sound came nearer and\r\nnearer; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we\r\nall sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right\r\ndown upon us within a distance of not much more than its length.\r\n\n\r\nFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it tossed\r\nand gaped beneath the ship\u2019s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract;\r\nand then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more till it came up\r\nweltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas, and\r\nwere at last taken up and safely landed on board. Ere the squall came close to,\r\nthe other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good\r\ntime. The ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light\r\nupon some token of our perishing,\u2014an oar or a lance pole.CHAPTER XLIX.THE HYENA\n\r\nThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we\r\ncall life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke,\r\nthough the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the\r\njoke is at nobody\u2019s expense but his own. However, nothing dispirits, and\r\nnothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all events, all creeds, and\r\nbeliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how\r\nknobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints.\r\nAnd as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster,\r\nperil of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,\r\ngood-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and\r\nunaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes\r\nover a man only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst\r\nof his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing\r\nmost momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing like\r\nthe perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado\r\nphilosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the\r\ngreat White Whale its object.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the\r\ndeck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water;\r\n\u201cQueequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?\u201d\r\nWithout much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to\r\nunderstand that such things did often happen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Stubb,\u201d said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in\r\nhis oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; \u201cMr. Stubb,\r\nI think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief mate,\r\nMr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose then, that\r\ngoing plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the\r\nheight of a whaleman\u2019s discretion?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCertain. I\u2019ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off\r\nCape Horn.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMr. Flask,\u201d said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing\r\nclose by; \u201cyou are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you\r\ntell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an\r\noarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into death\u2019s\r\njaws?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you twist that smaller?\u201d said Flask. \u201cYes,\r\nthat\u2019s the law. I should like to see a boat\u2019s crew backing water up\r\nto a whale face foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint,\r\nmind that!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of the\r\nentire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in the water\r\nand consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common occurrence in this\r\nkind of life; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going\r\non to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the\r\nboat\u2014oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness\r\nupon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings;\r\nconsidering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly\r\nto be imputed to Starbuck\u2019s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth\r\nof a squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his\r\ngreat heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to this\r\nuncommonly prudent Starbuck\u2019s boat; and finally considering in what a\r\ndevil\u2019s chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all\r\nthings together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make a rough\r\ndraft of my will. \u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, \u201ccome along, you shall\r\nbe my lawyer, executor, and legatee.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last\r\nwills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond of that\r\ndiversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the\r\nsame thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion, I felt\r\nall the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart. Besides, all the days I\r\nshould now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his\r\nresurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case\r\nmight be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest. I\r\nlooked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean\r\nconscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.\r\n\n\r\nNow then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock, here\r\ngoes a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the devil fetch the\r\nhindmost.CHAPTER L.AHAB\u2019S BOAT AND CREW. FEDALLAH\n\r\n\u201cWho would have thought it, Flask!\u201d cried Stubb; \u201cif I had\r\nbut one leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the\r\nplug-hole with my timber toe. Oh! he\u2019s a wonderful old man!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it so strange, after all, on that account,\u201d\r\nsaid Flask. \u201cIf his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different\r\nthing. That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other\r\nleft, you know.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him\r\nkneel.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAmong whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the\r\nparamount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right for\r\na whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase. So\r\nTamerlane\u2019s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that\r\ninvaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight.\r\n\n\r\nBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that with two\r\nlegs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger; considering that the\r\npursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that\r\nevery individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these\r\ncircumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?\r\nAs a general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought\r\nnot.\r\n\n\r\nAhab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his\r\nentering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase,\r\nfor the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person,\r\nyet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular\r\nheadsman in the hunt\u2014above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five\r\nextra men, as that same boat\u2019s crew, he well knew that such generous\r\nconceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had\r\nnot solicited a boat\u2019s crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his\r\ndesires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own\r\ntouching all that matter. Until Cabaco\u2019s published discovery, the sailors\r\nhad little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out\r\nof port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\r\nwhaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found\r\nbestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for\r\nwhat was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting\r\nthe small wooden skewers, which when the line is running out are pinned over\r\nthe groove in the bow: when all this was observed in him, and particularly his\r\nsolicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as\r\nif to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also\r\nthe anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as\r\nit is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat\u2019s bow for\r\nbracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was\r\nobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the\r\nsemi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter\u2019s chisel\r\ngouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these things,\r\nI say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But almost\r\neverybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must\r\nonly be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already\r\nrevealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a\r\nsupposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any\r\nboat\u2019s crew being assigned to that boat.\r\n\n\r\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away; for\r\nin a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such unaccountable odds\r\nand ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the\r\nearth to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often\r\npick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on\r\nplanks, bits of wreck, oars, whale-boats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and\r\nwhat not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the\r\ncabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable\r\nexcitement in the forecastle.\r\n\n\r\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms\r\nsoon found their place among the crew, though still as it were somehow distinct\r\nfrom them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the\r\nlast. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of\r\nunaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab\u2019s\r\npeculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence;\r\nHeaven knows, but it might have been even authority over him; all this none\r\nknew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was\r\nsuch a creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in\r\ntheir dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide among\r\nthe unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east\r\nof the continent\u2014those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries,\r\nwhich even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly\r\naboriginalness of earth\u2019s primal generations, when the memory of the\r\nfirst man was a distinct recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing\r\nwhence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the\r\nmoon why they were created and to what end; when though, according to Genesis,\r\nthe angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the\r\nuncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.CHAPTER LI.THE SPIRIT-SPOUT\n\r\nDays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept\r\nacross four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de\r\nVerdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata;\r\nand the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from St. Helena.\r\n\n\r\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight\r\nnight, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and, by their soft,\r\nsuffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude: on\r\nsuch a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles\r\nat the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and\r\nglittering god uprising from the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of\r\nthese moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and\r\nstand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,\r\nthough herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would\r\nventure a lowering for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen\r\nbeheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and\r\nthe moon, companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval\r\nthere for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when,\r\nafter all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery,\r\nmoon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged\r\nspirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. \u201cThere she\r\nblows!\u201d Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered\r\nmore; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was a most\r\nunwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that\r\nalmost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.\r\n\n\r\nWalking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\r\nt\u2019gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best\r\nman in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the\r\npiled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving, lifting\r\ntendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails, made the\r\nbuoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet; while still she\r\nrushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in\r\nher\u2014one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some\r\nhorizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab\u2019s face that night, you would\r\nhave thought that in him also two different things were warring. While his one\r\nlive leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb\r\nsounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though\r\nthe ship so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager\r\nglances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every sailor\r\nswore he saw it once, but not a second time.\r\n\n\r\nThis midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days after,\r\nlo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it was descried by\r\nall; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it disappeared as if it had\r\nnever been. And so it served us night after night, till no one heeded it but to\r\nwonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as\r\nthe case might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three;\r\nand somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further\r\nand further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.\r\n\n\r\nNor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the\r\npreternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the Pequod, were\r\nthere wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried;\r\nat however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that\r\nunnearable spout was cast by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick.\r\nFor a time, there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting\r\napparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that\r\nthe monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest and\r\nmost savage seas.\r\n\n\r\nThese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous\r\npotency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath all its\r\nblue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for days and\r\ndays we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all\r\nspace, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life\r\nbefore our urn-like prow.\r\n\n\r\nBut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling around\r\nus, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are there; when the\r\nivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the dark waves in her\r\nmadness, till, like showers of silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her\r\nbulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to\r\nsights more dismal than before.\r\n\n\r\nClose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before\r\nus; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And every morning,\r\nperched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and spite of our hootings,\r\nfor a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship\r\nsome drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and\r\ntherefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves. And heaved and heaved,\r\nstill unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience;\r\nand the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and\r\nsuffering it had bred.\r\n\n\r\nCape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoto, as called of yore;\r\nfor long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us, we\r\nfound ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty beings\r\ntransformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on\r\neverlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air without any\r\nhorizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of\r\nfeathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would\r\nat times be descried.\r\n\n\r\nDuring all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the time\r\nthe almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck, manifested the\r\ngloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates. In\r\ntempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been\r\nsecured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale.\r\nThen Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg\r\ninserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud,\r\nAhab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\r\noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes\r\ntogether. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the\r\nperilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the\r\nbulwarks in the waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each\r\nman had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he\r\nswung as in a loosened belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship,\r\nas if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the\r\nswift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of\r\nhumanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the men\r\nswung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when\r\nwearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his\r\nhammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old man\u2019s aspect, when one night\r\ngoing down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him with\r\nclosed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain and\r\nhalf-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged,\r\nstill slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him\r\nlay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously\r\nbeen spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the\r\nbody was erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed\r\ntowards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.[9]\n\n\r\nTerrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale, still\r\nthou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\r\n\n\n [9]\r\nThe cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the compass\r\nat the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the\r\nship.CHAPTER LII.THE ALBATROSS\n\r\nSouth-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising ground\r\nfor Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by name. As she\r\nslowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head, I had a good view\r\nof that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries\u2014a whaler\r\nat sea, and long absent from home.\r\n\n\r\nAs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the skeleton of\r\na stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral appearance was traced with\r\nlong channels of reddened rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like\r\nthe thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails\r\nwere set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three\r\nmast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the\r\nraiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops\r\nnailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though,\r\nwhen the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came\r\nso nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of\r\none ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly\r\neyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while the\r\nquarter-deck hail was being heard from below.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShip ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the act of\r\nputting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand into the sea;\r\nand the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make himself heard without\r\nit. Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between. While in\r\nvarious silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of\r\nthis ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale\u2019s name\r\nto another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would\r\nhave lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind\r\nforbade. But taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his\r\ntrumpet, and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer\r\nand shortly bound home, he loudly hailed\u2014\u201cAhoy there! This is the\r\nPequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters to the\r\nPacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to\r\naddress them to\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in\r\naccordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that for\r\nsome days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away with what\r\nseemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with the\r\nstranger\u2019s flanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab\r\nmust often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the\r\nveriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSwim away from me, do ye?\u201d murmured Ahab, gazing over into the\r\nwater. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep\r\nhelpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning\r\nto the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to\r\ndiminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,\u2014\u201cUp helm!\r\nKeep her off round the world!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nRound the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but\r\nwhereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils\r\nto the very point whence we started, where those that we left behind secure,\r\nwere all the time before us.\r\n\n\r\nWere this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for ever\r\nreach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any\r\nCyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage. But\r\nin pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that\r\ndemon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts; while\r\nchasing such over this round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or\r\nmidway leave us whelmed.CHAPTER LIII.THE GAM\n\r\nThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken\r\nwas this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this not been the\r\ncase, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her\u2014judging by his\r\nsubsequent conduct on similar occasions\u2014if so it had been that, by the\r\nprocess of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put.\r\nFor, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for five\r\nminutes, with any stranger captain, except he could contribute some of that\r\ninformation he so absorbingly sought. But all this might remain inadequately\r\nestimated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages of\r\nwhaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on a\r\ncommon cruising-ground.\r\n\n\r\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the equally\r\ndesolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each other in\r\nsuch inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a\r\nmutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news; and,\r\nperhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how much more\r\nnatural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea,\r\ntwo whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth\u2014off\r\nlone Fanning\u2019s Island, or the far away King\u2019s Mills; how much more\r\nnatural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only\r\ninterchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and sociable\r\ncontact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of course, in the case\r\nof vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of\r\nthe men are personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of\r\ndear domestic things to talk about.\r\n\n\r\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on board;\r\nat any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or\r\ntwo later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files. And in return\r\nfor that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling\r\nintelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of\r\nthe utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\r\nwhaling vessels crossing each other\u2019s track on the cruising-ground\r\nitself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of them may\r\nhave received a transfer of letters from some third, and now far remote vessel;\r\nand some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets.\r\nBesides, they would exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable chat. For\r\nnot only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with\r\nall the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually\r\nshared privations and perils.\r\n\n\r\nNor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that is, so\r\nlong as both parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and\r\nEnglish. Though, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such\r\nmeetings do not very often occur, and when they do occur there is too apt to be\r\na sort of shyness between them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and\r\nyour Yankee, he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.\r\nBesides, the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan\r\nsuperiority over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer,\r\nwith his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this\r\nsuperiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to\r\nsay, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than\r\nall the English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless little\r\nfoible in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much\r\nto heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.\r\n\n\r\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have\r\nmost reason to be sociable\u2014and they are so. Whereas, some merchant ships\r\ncrossing each other\u2019s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on\r\nwithout so much as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on\r\nthe high seas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging,\r\nperhaps, in finical criticism upon each other\u2019s rig. As for Men-of-War,\r\nwhen they chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of silly\r\nbowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to\r\nbe much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As\r\ntouching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they\r\nrun away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they\r\nchance to cross each other\u2019s cross-bones, the first hail\r\nis\u2014\u201cHow many skulls?\u201d\u2014the same way that whalers\r\nhail\u2014\u201cHow many barrels?\u201d And that question once answered,\r\npirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides,\r\nand don\u2019t like to see overmuch of each other\u2019s villanous\r\nlikenesses.\r\n\n\r\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\r\nfree-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in\r\nany sort of decent weather? She has a \u201cGam\u201d, a thing so\r\nutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even; and\r\nif by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat gamesome\r\nstuff about \u201cspouters\u201d and \u201cblubber-boilers\u201d, and such\r\nlike pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also all\r\nPirates and Man-of-War\u2019s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a\r\nscornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard to\r\nanswer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know whether\r\nthat profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It sometimes ends in\r\nuncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And besides, when a man is\r\nelevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior\r\naltitude. Hence, I conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a\r\nwhaleman, in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.\r\n\n\r\nBut what is a Gam? you might wear out your index-finger running up and\r\ndown the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson never\r\nattained to that erudition; Noah Webster\u2019s ark does not hold it.\r\nNevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant\r\nuse among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly it needs a\r\ndefinition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon. With that view, let me\r\nlearnedly define it.\r\n\n\r\nGAM. NOUN\u2014A social meeting of two (or more)\r\nWhale-ships, generally on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails,\r\nthey exchange visits by boats\u2019 crews: the two captains remaining, for the\r\ntime, on board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.\n\n\r\nThere is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here.\r\nAll professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale\r\nfishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed\r\nanywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable,\r\nsometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little\r\nmilliner\u2019s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the\r\nwhale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at\r\nall. High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on\r\ncastors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the\r\nwhale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a\r\ncomplete boat\u2019s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer\r\nor harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the\r\noccasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his\r\nvisit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that being\r\nconscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides\r\nof the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance of\r\nsustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very easy\r\nmatter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now\r\nand then in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his\r\nknees in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only\r\nexpand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden,\r\nviolent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of\r\nfoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a spread angle\r\nof two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it would never do in\r\nplain sight of the world\u2019s riveted eyes, it would never do, I say, for\r\nthis straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by\r\ncatching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire,\r\nbuoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands in his trowsers\u2019\r\npockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them\r\nthere for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well\r\nauthenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly\r\ncritical moment or two, in a sudden squall say\u2014to seize hold of the\r\nnearest oarsman\u2019s hair, and hold on there like grim death.CHAPTER LIV.THE TOWN-HO\u2019S STORY\n\r\n(As told at the Golden Inn.)\r\n\n\r\nThe Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is much\r\nlike some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet more travellers\r\nthan in any other part.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound\r\nwhaleman, the Town-Ho,[10]\r\nwas encountered. She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam\r\nthat ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest\r\nin the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the\r\nTown-Ho\u2019s story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a\r\ncertain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of\r\nGod which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance,\r\nwith its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret\r\npart of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain\r\nAhab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain\r\nof the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate white\r\nseamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with\r\nRomish injunctions of secresy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his\r\nsleep, and revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he\r\ncould not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this\r\nthing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it,\r\nand by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this\r\nmatter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired\r\nabaft the Pequod\u2019s main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this\r\ndarker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of\r\nthis strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record.\r\n\n \n[10] The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale\r\nfrom the mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos\r\nterrapin.\r\n\n\r\nFor my humor\u2019s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated\r\nit at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint\u2019s eve,\r\nsmoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine\r\ncavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with\r\nme; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and which are\r\nduly answered at the time.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSome two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\r\nrehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was\r\ncruising in your Pacific here, not very many days\u2019 sail westward from the\r\neaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line.\r\nOne morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed\r\nthat she made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a sword-fish\r\nhad stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for\r\nbelieving that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore\r\nbeing very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all\r\ndangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as\r\nlow down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her\r\ncruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no\r\ngood luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered,\r\nbut it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain,\r\nmaking all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to\r\nhave his hull hove out and repaired.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThough no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\r\nfavored, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way, because\r\nhis pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those\r\nsix-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the\r\nleak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being\r\nattended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived\r\nin perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had\r\nit not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and\r\nthe bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from\r\nBuffalo.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Lakeman!\u2014Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is\r\nBuffalo?\u2019 said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but\u2014I crave your\r\ncourtesy\u2014may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now, gentlemen,\r\nin square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large and stout as\r\nany that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla; this lakeman, in\r\nthe land-locked heart of our America, had yet been nurtured by all those\r\nagrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean. For\r\nin their interflowing aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of\r\nours\u2014Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and Superior, and\r\nMichigan,\u2014possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the\r\nocean\u2019s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of\r\nclimes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the\r\nPolynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting\r\nnations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our\r\nnumerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks; here\r\nand there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of\r\nlofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at\r\nintervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces\r\nflash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\r\nancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines\r\nof kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of\r\nprey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors;\r\nthey mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago\r\nvillages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of\r\nthe State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and\r\ndismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what\r\nshipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned\r\nfull many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though\r\nan inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of\r\nan audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have\r\nlaid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though\r\nin after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative\r\nPacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the\r\nbackwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives.\r\nYet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman,\r\na mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness,\r\nonly tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest\r\nslave\u2019s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained\r\nharmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was\r\ndoomed and made mad, and Steelkilt\u2014but, gentlemen, you shall hear.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her\r\nprow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho\u2019s leak seemed again\r\nincreasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day.\r\nYou must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for\r\nexample, some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it;\r\nthough of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to\r\nforget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his\r\nshipmates would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently\r\nsubsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to\r\nthe westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at\r\ntheir pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;\r\nthat is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other\r\nreasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some\r\nvery out of the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that\r\nher captain begins to feel a little anxious.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMuch this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found\r\ngaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by several\r\nof her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails to\r\nbe well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now\r\nthis Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to\r\nany sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,\r\nunthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine,\r\ngentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the\r\nship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a\r\npart owner in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there\r\nwas on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood\r\nwith their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as\r\nany mountain spring, gentlemen\u2014that bubbling from the pumps ran across\r\nthe deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional\r\nworld of ours\u2014watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command\r\nover his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in\r\ngeneral pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an\r\nunconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down\r\nand pulverize that subaltern\u2019s tower, and make a little heap of dust of\r\nit. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a\r\ntall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like\r\nthe tasseled housings of your last viceroy\u2019s snorting charger; and a\r\nbrain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt\r\nCharlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne\u2019s father. But Radney,\r\nthe mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did\r\nnot love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEspying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\r\nrest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his gay\r\nbanterings.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Aye, aye, my merry lads, it\u2019s a lively leak this; hold a\r\ncannikin, one of ye, and let\u2019s have a taste. By the Lord, it\u2019s\r\nworth bottling! I tell ye what, men, old Rad\u2019s investment must go for it!\r\nhe had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys,\r\nthat sword-fish only began the job; he\u2019s come back again with a gang of\r\nship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of\r\n\u2019em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making\r\nimprovements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I\u2019d tell him to jump\r\noverboard and scatter \u2019em. They\u2019re playing the devil with his\r\nestate, I can tell him. But he\u2019s a simple old soul,\u2014Rad, and a\r\nbeauty too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in\r\nlooking-glasses. I wonder if he\u2019d give a poor devil like me the model of\r\nhis nose.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Damn your eyes! what\u2019s that pump stopping for?\u2019\r\nroared Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailors\u2019 talk.\r\n\u2018Thunder away at it!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Aye, aye, sir,\u2019 said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket.\r\n\u2018Lively, boys, lively, now!\u2019 And with that the pump clanged like\r\nfifty fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that\r\npeculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of\r\nlife\u2019s utmost energies.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQuitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\r\nforward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red,\r\nhis eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what\r\ncozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a\r\nman in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so it happened.\r\nIntolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and\r\nsweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters\r\nconsequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, gentlemen, sweeping a ship\u2019s deck at sea is a piece of\r\nhousehold work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to\r\nevery evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\r\nfoundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea-usages and\r\nthe instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom would not willingly\r\ndrown without first washing their faces. But in all vessels this broom business\r\nis the prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it\r\nwas the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking\r\nturns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt\r\nhad been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should\r\nhave been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical\r\nduties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars\r\nso that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\r\nplainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in his\r\nface. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; and all\r\nthis and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate\r\nuttered his command. But as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly\r\nlooked into the mate\u2019s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of\r\npowder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards\r\nthem; as he instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and\r\nunwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful\r\nbeing\u2014a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men\r\neven when aggrieved\u2014this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over\r\nSteelkilt.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTherefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\r\nexhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the deck\r\nwas not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without at all alluding\r\nto the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers; who, not\r\nbeing billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this,\r\nRadney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\r\nunconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the still\r\nseated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper\u2019s club hammer which he had\r\nsnatched from a cask near by.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHeated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\r\nall his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but\r\nill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the\r\nconflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his\r\nseat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of\r\nhis face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSteelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\r\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his\r\nintention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the\r\nslightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand\r\nhe warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in\r\nthis way the two went once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no\r\nlonger to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported\r\nwith his humor, the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the\r\nofficer:\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look\r\nto yourself.\u2019 But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\r\nwhere the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his\r\nteeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating\r\nnot the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the\r\nunflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind\r\nhim and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but\r\ngrazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had\r\nbeen branded for the slaughter by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the\r\ncheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he\r\nfell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEre the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\r\nleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mast-heads.\r\nThey were both Canallers.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Canallers!\u2019 cried Don Pedro, \u2018We have seen many\r\nwhale-ships in our harbors, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and\r\nwhat are they?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie\r\nCanal. You must have heard of it.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and\r\nhereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha\u2019s very\r\nfine; and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for\r\nsuch information may throw side-light upon my story.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth\r\nof the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and most thriving\r\nvillages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent, cultivated\r\nfields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and bar-room; through the\r\nholy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through\r\nsun and shade; by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting\r\nscenery of those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white\r\nchapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream\r\nof Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life. There\u2019s your true Ashantee,\r\ngentlemen; there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\r\nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronizing lee of churches. For by\r\nsome curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters\r\nthat they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most\r\nabound in holiest vicinities.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is that a friar passing?\u2019 said Don Pedro, looking downwards\r\ninto the crowded plazza, with humorous concern.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella\u2019s Inquisition\r\nwanes in Lima,\u2019 laughed Don Sebastian. \u2018Proceed, Senor.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018A moment! Pardon!\u2019 cried another of the company. \u2018In\r\nthe name of all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we\r\nhave by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for\r\ndistant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look surprised;\r\nyou know the proverb all along this coast\u2014\u201cCorrupt as Lima.\u201d\r\nIt but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than\r\nbilliard-tables, and for ever open\u2014and \u201cCorrupt as Lima.\u201d So,\r\ntoo, Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.\r\nMark!\u2014St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you\r\npour out again.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFreely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make\r\na fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like Mark\r\nAntony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently\r\nfloats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot\r\nthigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed. The\r\nbrigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and\r\ngaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features. A terror to the smiling\r\ninnocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart visage and bold\r\nswagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have\r\nreceived good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would\r\nfain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of\r\nyour man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor\r\nstranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the\r\nwildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by this; that our wild\r\nwhale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce\r\nany race of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling\r\ncaptains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to\r\nmany thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the\r\nprobationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between\r\nquietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the waters\r\nof the most barbaric seas.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I see! I see!\u2019 impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling\r\nhis chicha upon his silvery ruffles. \u2018No need to travel! The\r\nworld\u2019s one Lima. I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the\r\ngenerations were cold and holy as the hills.\u2014But the story.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the back-stay. Hardly had\r\nhe done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four\r\nharpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes like\r\nbaleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag\r\ntheir man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with\r\nthem in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of\r\nharm\u2019s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike,\r\ncalling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him\r\nalong to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving\r\nborder of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought\r\nto prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes\r\nwere too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck,\r\nwhere, hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the\r\nwindlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the\r\nbarricade.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Come out of that, ye pirates!\u2019 roared the captain, now\r\nmenacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.\r\n\u2018Come out of that, ye cut-throats!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSteelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,\r\ndefied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand\r\ndistinctly, that his (Steelkilt\u2019s) death would be the signal for a\r\nmurderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might\r\nprove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the\r\ninsurgents instantly to return to their duty.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?\u2019 demanded their\r\nringleader.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Turn to! turn to!\u2014I make no promise;\u2014to your duty! Do\r\nyou want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!\u2019\r\nand he once more raised a pistol.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Sink the ship?\u2019 cried Steelkilt. \u2018Aye, let her sink.\r\nNot a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us.\r\nWhat say ye, men?\u2019 turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their\r\nresponse.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye\r\non the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as\r\nthese:\u2014\u2018It\u2019s not our fault; we didn\u2019t want it; I told\r\nhim to take his hammer away; it was boy\u2019s business; he might have known\r\nme before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a\r\nfinger here against his cursed jaw; ain\u2019t those mincing knives down in\r\nthe forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by\r\nGod, look to yourself; say the word; don\u2019t be a fool; forget it all; we\r\nare ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we\u2019re your men; but we\r\nwon\u2019t be flogged.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Look ye, now,\u2019 cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm\r\ntowards him, \u2018there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have\r\nshipped for the cruise, d\u2019ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim\r\nour discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don\u2019t want a row;\r\nit\u2019s not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but\r\nwe won\u2019t be flogged.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Turn to!\u2019 roared the Captain.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSteelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:\u2014\u2018I tell\r\nyou what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby\r\nrascal, we won\u2019t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you\r\nsay the word about not flogging us, we won\u2019t do a hand\u2019s\r\nturn.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I\u2019ll keep ye\r\nthere till ye\u2019re sick of it. Down ye go.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Shall we?\u2019 cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them\r\nwere against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him\r\ndown into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs the Lakeman\u2019s bare head was just level with the planks, the\r\nCaptain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide\r\nof the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the\r\nsteward to bring the heavy brass padlock, belonging to the companion-way. Then\r\nopening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down the crack,\r\nclosed it, and turned the key upon them\u2014ten in number\u2014leaving on\r\ndeck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and\r\naft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last\r\nplace it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through the\r\nbulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still\r\nremained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking\r\nat intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt sunrise the captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned\r\nthe prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then lowered\r\ndown to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it; when\r\nagain turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the\r\nquarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this was repeated; but on the\r\nfourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the\r\ncustomary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the\r\nforecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air,\r\nand a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had\r\nconstrained them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain\r\nreiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific\r\nhint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth\r\nmorning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate\r\narms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Better turn to, now?\u2019 said the Captain with a heartless\r\njeer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Shut us up again, will ye!\u2019 cried Steelkilt.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Oh! certainly,\u2019 said the Captain and the key clicked.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven\r\nof his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed\r\nhim, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of\r\ndespair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far\r\napparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next\r\nsummoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long,\r\ncrescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each end) run a muck from the\r\nbowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible,\r\nseize the ship. For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him\r\nor not. That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met\r\nwith no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for\r\nthat, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And\r\nwhat was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the\r\ntime to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely\r\nobjected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades\r\nwould not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them could\r\nnot be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time. And here,\r\ngentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUpon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\r\nseparate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of\r\ntreachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of\r\nthe three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure\r\nwhatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt\r\nmade known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way,\r\nby some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries\r\ntogether; and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls\r\nto each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged\r\nhim with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and\r\nall his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes\r\nthe scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling\r\nringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once\r\nclaimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder. But all\r\nthese were collared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by\r\nside, were seized up into the mizen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and\r\nthere they hung till morning. \u2018Damn ye,\u2019 cried the Captain, pacing\r\nto and fro before them, \u2018the vultures would not touch ye, ye\r\nvillains!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAt sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled\r\nfrom those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he had\r\na good mind to flog them all round\u2014thought, upon the whole, he would do\r\nso\u2014he ought to\u2014justice demanded it; but for the present,\r\nconsidering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a reprimand,\r\nwhich he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But as for you, ye carrion rogues,\u2019 turning to the three\r\nmen in the rigging\u2014\u2018for you, I mean to mince ye up for the\r\ntry-pots;\u2019 and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the\r\nbacks of the two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their\r\nheads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018My wrist is sprained with ye!\u2019 he cried, at last;\r\n\u2018but there is still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that\r\nwouldn\u2019t give up. Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he\r\ncan say for himself.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\r\ncramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of\r\nhiss, \u2018What I say is this\u2014and mind it well\u2014if you flog me, I\r\nmurder you!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me\u2019\u2014and the\r\nCaptain drew off with the rope to strike.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Best not,\u2019 hissed the Lakeman.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018But I must,\u2019\u2014and the rope was once more drawn back\r\nfor the stroke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSteelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;\r\nwho, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or\r\nthree times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, \u2018I\r\nwon\u2019t do it\u2014let him go\u2014cut him down: d\u2019ye hear?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man,\r\nwith a bandaged head, arrested them\u2014Radney the chief mate. Ever since the\r\nblow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult on the\r\ndeck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the\r\nstate of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about\r\nhis being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he\r\nsnatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You are a coward!\u2019 hissed the Lakeman.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018So I am, but take that.\u2019 The mate was in the very act of\r\nstriking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then\r\npausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt\u2019s threat,\r\nwhatever that might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were\r\nturned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as\r\nbefore.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cJust after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was\r\nheard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up, besieged\r\nthe cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew. Entreaties, cuffs,\r\nand kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put\r\ndown in the ship\u2019s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared\r\namong the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt\u2019s\r\ninstigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all\r\norders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But\r\nin order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another\r\nthing\u2014namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be\r\ndiscovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the\r\nTown-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to\r\nlower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising\r\nground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat,\r\nand with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\r\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was\r\nover) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung\r\nhim in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate\u2019s\r\nwatch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet\r\nhis doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express\r\ncounsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon\r\nthis, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the\r\nplan of his revenge.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDuring the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\r\nbulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat\r\nwhich was hoisted up there, a little above the ship\u2019s side. In this\r\nattitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable\r\nvacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea.\r\nSteelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm would\r\ncome round at two o\u2019clock, in the morning of the third day from that in\r\nwhich he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in\r\nbraiding something very carefully in his watches below.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What are you making there?\u2019 said a shipmate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What do you think? what does it look like?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Like a lanyard for your bag; but it\u2019s an odd one, seems to\r\nme.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Yes, rather oddish,\u2019 said the Lakeman, holding it at\r\narm\u2019s length before him; \u2018but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I\r\nhaven\u2019t enough twine,\u2014have you any?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut there was none in the forecastle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then I must get some from old Rad;\u2019 and he rose to go aft.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You don\u2019t mean to go a begging to him!\u2019 said a\r\nsailor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Why not? Do you think he won\u2019t do me a turn, when\r\nit\u2019s to help himself in the end, shipmate?\u2019 and going to the mate,\r\nhe looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It\r\nwas given him\u2014neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next\r\nnight an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\r\nLakeman\u2019s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for\r\na pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm\u2014nigh to\r\nthe man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the\r\nseaman\u2019s hand\u2014that fatal hour was then to come; and in the\r\nfore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a\r\ncorpse, with his forehead crushed in.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed\r\nhe had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger. For\r\nby a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his\r\nhands into its own the damning thing he would have done.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\r\nday, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man,\r\ndrawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, \u2018There she\r\nrolls! there she rolls!\u2019 Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Moby Dick!\u2019 cried Don Sebastian; \u2018St. Dominic! Sir\r\nsailor, but do whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster,\r\nDon;\u2014but that would be too long a story.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018How? how!\u2019 cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Nay, Dons, Dons\u2014nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let\r\nme get more into the air, Sirs.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018The chicha! the chicha!\u2019 cried Don Pedro; \u2018our\r\nvigorous friend looks faint;\u2014fill up his empty glass!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.\u2014Now, gentlemen, so\r\nsuddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the\r\nship\u2014forgetful of the compact among the crew\u2014in the excitement of\r\nthe moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his\r\nvoice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly\r\nbeheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. \u2018The\r\nWhite Whale\u2014the White Whale!\u2019 was the cry from captain, mates, and\r\nharpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumors, were all anxious to capture so\r\nfamous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with\r\ncurses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a\r\nhorizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue\r\nmorning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these\r\nevents, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted. The\r\nmutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty\r\nto sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in\r\nor slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were\r\nlowered, the mate\u2019s got the start; and none howled more fiercely with\r\ndelight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull,\r\ntheir harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was\r\nalways a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to\r\nbeach him on the whale\u2019s topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled\r\nhim up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together;\r\ntill of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over,\r\nspilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale\u2019s\r\nslippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while\r\nRadney was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\r\nout through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil,\r\nwildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale\r\nrushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and\r\nrearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMeantime, at the first tap of the boat\u2019s bottom, the Lakeman had\r\nslackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on,\r\nhe thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the\r\nboat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free.\r\nBut, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of\r\nRadney\u2019s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him.\r\nAll four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn good time, the Town-Ho reached her port\u2014a savage, solitary\r\nplace\u2014where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman,\r\nall but five or six of the foremast-men deliberately deserted among the palms;\r\neventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages,\r\nand setting sail for some other harbor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe ship\u2019s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain\r\ncalled upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\r\ndown the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their\r\ndangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and\r\nby day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel\r\nbeing ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the\r\ncaptain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel\r\nwith his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded\r\nand ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and\r\nwarning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man\r\nwith him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before\r\nthe wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to\r\nhis crew.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed\r\nto have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the\r\nsavage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to\r\nheave to, or he would run him under water. The captain presented a pistol. With\r\none foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to\r\nscorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would\r\nbury him in bubbles and foam.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018What do you want of me?\u2019 cried the captain.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?\u2019 demanded\r\nSteelkilt; \u2018no lies.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am bound to Tahiti for more men.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Very good. Let me board you a moment\u2014I come in\r\npeace.\u2019 With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and\r\nclimbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me.\r\nAs soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island,\r\nand remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike me!\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018A pretty scholar,\u2019 laughed the Lakeman. \u2018Adios,\r\nSenor!\u2019 and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWatching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots\r\nof the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at\r\nTahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two ships\r\nwere about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely\r\nthat number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and so for ever got\r\nthe start of their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal\r\nretribution.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSome ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and\r\nthe captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had\r\nbeen somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he returned\r\nwith them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his\r\ncruisings.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\r\nNantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up\r\nits dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him. * * *\r\n*\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Are you through?\u2019 said Don Sebastian, quietly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I am, Don.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own\r\nconvictions, this story is in substance really true? It is so passing\r\nwonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem\r\nto press.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don\r\nSebastian\u2019s suit,\u2019 cried the company, with exceeding interest.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,\r\ngentlemen?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Nay,\u2019 said Don Sebastian; \u2018but I know a worthy priest\r\nnear by, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well\r\nadvised? this may grow too serious.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Though there are no Auto-da-F\u00e9s in Lima now,\u2019 said one of\r\nthe company to another: \u2018I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the\r\narchiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need for\r\nthis.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also\r\nbeg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you\r\ncan.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,\u2019 said\r\nDon Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the\r\nlight, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.\u2019\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2018So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye,\r\ngentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be true; it\r\nhappened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and talked\r\nwith Steelkilt since the death of Radney.\u2019\u201dCHAPTER LV.OF THE MONSTROUS PICTURES OF WHALES\n\r\nI shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas, something like\r\nthe true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman\r\nwhen in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale-ship so\r\nthat he can be fairly stepped upon there. It may be worth while, therefore,\r\npreviously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even\r\ndown to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is\r\ntime to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the\r\nwhale all wrong.\r\n\n\r\nIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found\r\namong the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever since those\r\ninventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples, the\r\npedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin\r\nwas drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin\u2019s, and a helmeted head\r\nlike St. George\u2019s; ever since then has something of the same sort of\r\nlicense prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many\r\nscientific presentations of him.\r\n\n\r\nNow, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the\r\nwhale\u2019s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta, in\r\nIndia. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that\r\nimmemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of\r\nman, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being. No\r\nwonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been\r\nthere shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate\r\ndepartment of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of\r\nleviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is\r\nhalf man and half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that\r\nsmall section of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an\r\nanaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale\u2019s majestic flukes.\r\n\n\r\nBut go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter\u2019s\r\nportrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo.\r\nIt is Guido\u2019s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster\r\nor whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor\r\ndoes Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own \u201cPerseus\r\nDescending,\u201d make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of that\r\nHogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of\r\nwater. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into\r\nwhich the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors\u2019 Gate\r\nleading from the Thames by water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus\r\nwhales of the old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah\u2019s whale, as depicted in the\r\nprints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these?\r\nAs for the book-binder\u2019s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock\r\nof a descending anchor\u2014as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages\r\nof many books both old and new\u2014that is a very picturesque but purely\r\nfabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.\r\nThough universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\r\nbook-binder\u2019s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended when\r\nthe device was first introduced. It was introduced by an old Italian publisher\r\nsomewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those\r\ndays, and even down to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly\r\nsupposed to be a species of the Leviathan.\r\n\n\r\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at\r\ntimes meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of spouts,\r\njets d\u2019eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come bubbling\r\nup from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original edition of the\r\n\u201cAdvancement of Learning\u201d you will find some curious whales.\r\n\n\r\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those pictures\r\nof leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations, by those who\r\nknow. In old Harris\u2019s collection of voyages there are some plates of\r\nwhales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\r\nentitled \u201cA Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale,\r\nPeter Peterson of Friesland, master.\u201d In one of those plates the whales,\r\nlike great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with white\r\nbears running over their living backs. In another plate, the prodigious blunder\r\nis made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.\r\n\n\r\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a Post\r\nCaptain in the English navy, entitled \u201cA Voyage round Cape Horn into the\r\nSouth Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.\u201d\r\nIn this book is an outline purporting to be a \u201cPicture of a Physeter or\r\nSpermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico,\r\nAugust, 1793, and hoisted on deck.\u201d I doubt not the captain had this\r\nveracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines. To mention but one\r\nthing about it, let me say that it has an eye which applied, according to the\r\naccompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that\r\nwhale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not\r\ngive us Jonah looking out of that eye!\r\n\n\r\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit\r\nof the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of mistake. Look at\r\nthat popular work \u201cGoldsmith\u2019s Animated Nature.\u201d In the\r\nabridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged\r\n\u201cwhale\u201d and a \u201cnarwhale.\u201d I do not wish to seem\r\ninelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as\r\nfor the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\r\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any\r\nintelligent public of schoolboys.\r\n\n\r\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de, a great naturalist,\r\npublished a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are several pictures of\r\nthe different species of the Leviathan. All these are not only incorrect, but\r\nthe picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right\r\nwhale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man as touching that species,\r\ndeclares not to have its counterpart in nature.\r\n\n\r\nBut the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved\r\nfor the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron. In 1836, he\r\npublished a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he calls a\r\npicture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer, you\r\nhad best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick\r\nCuvier\u2019s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he\r\nnever had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he\r\nderived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific\r\npredecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions;\r\nthat is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil\r\nthose Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.\r\n\n\r\nAs for the sign-painters\u2019 whales seen in the streets hanging over the\r\nshops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally Richard\r\nIII. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on three or\r\nfour sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities\r\nfloundering in seas of blood and blue paint.\r\n\n\r\nBut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising\r\nafter all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the\r\nstranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship,\r\nwith broken back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its\r\nundashed pride of hull and spars. Though elephants have stood for their\r\nfull-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his\r\nportrait. The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be\r\nseen at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of\r\nsight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a\r\nthing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so\r\nas to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the\r\nhighly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a\r\nfull-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young\r\nsucking whales hoisted to a ship\u2019s deck, such is then the outlandish,\r\neel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise expression the devil\r\nhimself could not catch.\r\n\n\r\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,\r\naccurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one\r\nof the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very\r\nlittle idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham\u2019s skeleton, which\r\nhangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys\r\nthe idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy\u2019s\r\nother leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be\r\ninferred from any leviathan\u2019s articulated bones. In fact, as the great\r\nHunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the\r\nfully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so\r\nroundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as\r\nin some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously\r\ndisplayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the\r\nbones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular\r\nbone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are\r\npermanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an\r\nartificial covering. \u201cHowever recklessly the whale may sometimes serve\r\nus,\u201d said humorous Stubb one day, \u201che can never be truly said to\r\nhandle us without mittens.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\r\nconclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must\r\nremain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer\r\nthan another, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of\r\nexactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale\r\nreally looks like. And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable\r\nidea of his living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing,\r\nyou run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it\r\nseems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this\r\nLeviathan.CHAPTER LVI.OF THE LESS ERRONEOUS PICTURES OF\r\nWHALES, AND THE TRUE PICTURES OF WHALING SCENES\n\r\nIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted here\r\nto enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found\r\nin certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny, Purchas,\r\nHackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, &c. But I pass that matter by.\r\n\n\r\nI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\r\nColnett\u2019s, Huggins\u2019s, Frederick Cuvier\u2019s, and Beale\u2019s.\r\nIn the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to.\r\nHuggins\u2019s is far better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale\u2019s is\r\nthe best. All Beale\u2019s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the\r\nmiddle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his\r\nsecond chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt\r\ncalculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably\r\ncorrect and life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale drawings\r\nin J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but they are wretchedly\r\nengraved. That is not his fault though.\r\n\n\r\nOf the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they are\r\ndrawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has but one\r\npicture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because it is by such\r\npictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive anything like a\r\ntruthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters.\r\n\n\r\nBut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not the\r\nmost correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found,\r\nare two large French engravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by one\r\nGarnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In\r\nthe first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,\r\njust risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing\r\nhigh in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow\r\nof the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\r\nmonster\u2019s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single\r\nincomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the\r\nincensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a\r\nprecipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The\r\nhalf-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the\r\nspilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are\r\nscattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the\r\nblack stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault\r\nmight be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that pass;\r\nsince, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.\r\n\n\r\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the\r\nbarnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk\r\nin the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His jets are\r\nerect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a smoke in the\r\nchimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great\r\nbowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other\r\nsea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his\r\npestilent back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through\r\nthe deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the\r\nslight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of\r\nan ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in\r\nadmirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the\r\ndrooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead\r\nwhale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the\r\nwhale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.\r\n\n\r\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was\r\neither practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously tutored by\r\nsome experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for painting action. Go and\r\ngaze upon all the paintings in Europe, and where will you find such a gallery\r\nof living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at\r\nVersailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the\r\nconsecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the\r\nNorthern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\r\ncharge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are\r\nthese sea battle-pieces of Garnery.\r\n\n\r\nThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things\r\nseems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of\r\ntheir whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England\u2019s experience in the\r\nfishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans, they have\r\nnevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all\r\ncapable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt. For the most part, the\r\nEnglish and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting\r\nthe mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale;\r\nwhich, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\r\nsketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right\r\nwhaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three\r\nor four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series\r\nof classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with\r\nthe microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a\r\nshivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I\r\nmean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but\r\nin so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for\r\nevery crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.\r\n\n\r\nIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other French\r\nengravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself \u201cH.\r\nDurand.\u201d One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present\r\npurpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet\r\nnoon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore,\r\nin a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship,\r\nand the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together in\r\nthe breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to\r\nits presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental\r\nrepose. The other engraving is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon\r\nthe open sea, and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale\r\nalongside; the vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if\r\nto a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is\r\nabout giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie\r\nlevelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while\r\nfrom a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-erect out of the\r\nwater, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the\r\nboiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to\r\nwindward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to\r\nquicken the activity of the excited seamen.CHAPTER LVII.OF WHALES IN PAINT; IN TEETH; IN\r\nWOOD; IN SHEET-IRON; IN STONE; IN MOUNTAINS; IN STARS\n\r\nOn Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a crippled\r\nbeggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a painted board before\r\nhim, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There are three\r\nwhales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to contain the missing\r\nleg in all its original integrity) is being crunched by the jaws of the\r\nforemost whale. Any time these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up\r\nthat picture, and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of\r\nhis justification has now come. His three whales are as good whales as were\r\never published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump\r\nas any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on\r\nthat stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with\r\ndowncast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation.\r\n\n\r\nThroughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag Harbor,\r\nyou will come across lively sketches of whales and whaling-scenes, graven by\r\nthe fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies\u2019 busks wrought\r\nout of the Right Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles, as the\r\nwhalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve\r\nout of the rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have\r\nlittle boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\r\nskrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their jack-knives\r\nalone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor, they will turn you\r\nout anything you please, in the way of a mariner\u2019s fancy.\r\n\n\r\nLong exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that\r\ncondition in which God placed him, i. e. what is called savagery. Your\r\ntrue whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a savage;\r\nowning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready at any moment\r\nto rebel against him.\r\n\n\r\nNow, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours,\r\nis his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian war-club or\r\nspear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is as great\r\na trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, with but a bit of\r\nbroken sea-shell or a shark\u2019s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden\r\nnet-work has been achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady application.\r\n\n\r\nAs with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the same\r\nmarvellous patience, and with the same single shark\u2019s tooth, of his one\r\npoor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite as\r\nworkmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as the Greek\r\nsavage, Achilles\u2019s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and\r\nsuggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.\r\n\n\r\nWooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the\r\nnoble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles of\r\nAmerican whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.\r\n\n\r\nAt some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the\r\ntail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is sleepy, the\r\nanvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom\r\nremarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you\r\nwill see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-cocks; but they are so\r\nelevated, and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with\r\n\u201cHands off!\u201d you cannot examine them closely enough to\r\ndecide upon their merit.\r\n\n\r\nIn bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken cliffs\r\nmasses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain, you will often\r\ndiscover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in\r\ngrass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges.\r\n\n\r\nThen, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually\r\ngirdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky point of\r\nview you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along\r\nthe undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see these\r\nsights; and not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight again, you\r\nmust be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your\r\nfirst stand-point, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that\r\nyour precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery; like\r\nthe Solomon islands, which still remain incognita, though once high-ruffed\r\nMendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.\r\n\n\r\nNor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out great\r\nwhales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as when long filled\r\nwith thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the\r\nclouds. Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with\r\nthe revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me. And beneath\r\nthe effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the\r\nchase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the\r\nFlying Fish.\r\n\n\r\nWith a frigate\u2019s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for\r\nspurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see\r\nwhether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped\r\nbeyond my mortal sight!CHAPTER LVIII.BRIT\n\r\nSteering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of\r\nbrit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely feeds.\r\nFor leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to be sailing\r\nthrough boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.\r\n\n\r\nOn the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the\r\nattack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam\r\nthrough the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous\r\nVenetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the water\r\nthat escaped at the lip.\r\n\n\r\nAs morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes\r\nthrough the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monsters swam, making\r\na strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them endless swaths of\r\nblue upon the yellow sea.[11]\n\n\n [11]\r\nThat part of the sea known among whalemen as the \u201cBrazil Banks\u201d\r\ndoes not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there being\r\nshallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like\r\nappearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those\r\nlatitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.\r\n\n\r\nBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all\r\nreminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they paused\r\nand were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more like\r\nlifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great hunting\r\ncountries of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the\r\nplains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such, taking them for\r\nbare, blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the\r\nfirst time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea. And even when\r\nrecognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to\r\nbelieve that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all\r\nparts, with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.\r\n\n\r\nIndeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with\r\nthe same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though some old\r\nnaturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in\r\nthe sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very\r\nwell be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish\r\nany fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The\r\naccursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative\r\nanalogy to him.\r\n\n\r\nBut though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas have\r\never been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling; though we\r\nknow the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that Columbus sailed over\r\nnumberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one; though,\r\nby vast odds, the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and\r\nindiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone\r\nupon the waters; though but a moment\u2019s consideration will teach, that\r\nhowever baby man may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a\r\nflattering future, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for\r\never, to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize\r\nthe stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual\r\nrepetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full\r\nawfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.\r\n\n\r\nThe first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese vengeance\r\nhad whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow. That same ocean\r\nrolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year. Yea,\r\nfoolish mortals, Noah\u2019s flood is not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair\r\nworld it yet covers.\r\n\n\r\nWherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle\r\nupon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews, when under the\r\nfeet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for\r\never; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner the live\r\nsea swallows up ships and crews.\r\n\n\r\nBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also\r\na fiend to its own offspring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own\r\nguests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage\r\ntigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes\r\neven the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side\r\nwith the split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it.\r\nPanting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the\r\nmasterless ocean overruns the globe.\r\n\n\r\nConsider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under\r\nwater, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the\r\nloveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of\r\nmany of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many\r\nspecies of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea;\r\nall whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the\r\nworld began.\r\n\n\r\nConsider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile earth;\r\nconsider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy\r\nto something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant\r\nland, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and\r\njoy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life. God keep thee!\r\nPush not off from that isle, thou canst never return!CHAPTER LIX.SQUID\n\r\nSlowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her way\r\nnorth-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling her keel, so\r\nthat in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to\r\nthat languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And still, at wide\r\nintervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.\r\n\n\r\nBut one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural spread\r\nover the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the long\r\nburnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them,\r\nenjoining some secresy; when the slippered waves whispered together as they\r\nsoftly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre\r\nwas seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.\r\n\n\r\nIn the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and higher,\r\nand disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before our prow like a\r\nsnow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a moment, as slowly it\r\nsubsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and silently gleamed. It seemed not a\r\nwhale; and yet is this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down,\r\nbut on re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man\r\nfrom his nod, the negro yelled out\u2014\u201cThere! there again! there she\r\nbreaches! right ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUpon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the bees\r\nrush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the bowsprit,\r\nand with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the\r\nhelmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the\r\noutstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.\r\n\n\r\nWhether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually\r\nworked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness\r\nand repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued; however\r\nthis was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have\r\nbeen, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick\r\nintensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.\r\n\n\r\nThe four boats were soon on the water; Ahab\u2019s in advance, and all swiftly\r\npulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with oars suspended,\r\nwe were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where it sank, once\r\nmore it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby\r\nDick, we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have\r\nhitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and\r\nbreadth, of a glancing cream-color, lay floating on the water, innumerable long\r\narms radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of\r\nanacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach. No\r\nperceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of either sensation\r\nor instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless,\r\nchance-like apparition of life.\r\n\n\r\nAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still gazing\r\nat the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice\r\nexclaimed\u2014\u201cAlmost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than\r\nto have seen thee, thou white ghost!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat was it, Sir?\u201d said Flask.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe great live squid, which they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and\r\nreturned to their ports to tell of it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the rest\r\nas silently following.\r\n\n\r\nWhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the\r\nsight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so very\r\nunusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness. So\r\nrarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them declare it to be the\r\nlargest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few of them have any but the most\r\nvague ideas concerning its true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe\r\nit to furnish to the sperm whale his only food. For though other species of\r\nwhales find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of\r\nfeeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the\r\nsurface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely,\r\nthat food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are\r\nsupposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited\r\nexceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to\r\nwhich these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean;\r\nand that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order\r\nto attack and tear it.\r\n\n\r\nThere seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan\r\nmay ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which the Bishop\r\ndescribes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some other particulars he\r\nnarrates, in all this the two correspond. But much abatement is necessary with\r\nrespect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.\r\n\n\r\nBy some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature,\r\nhere spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish, to which,\r\nindeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong, but only as the\r\nAnak of the tribe.CHAPTER LX.THE LINE\n\r\nWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as for the\r\nbetter understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to\r\nspeak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.\r\n\n\r\nThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly vapored\r\nwith tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary ropes; for while\r\ntar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and\r\nalso renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use;\r\nyet, not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for\r\nthe close coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are\r\nbeginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope\u2019s\r\ndurability or strength, however much it may give it compactness and gloss.\r\n\n\r\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely\r\nsuperseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable as\r\nhemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since\r\nthere is an \u00e6sthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming to\r\nthe boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but\r\nManilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.\r\n\n\r\nThe whale line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you\r\nwould not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty\r\nyarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the\r\nwhole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, the common\r\nsperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern\r\nof the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a\r\nstill though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded\r\n\u201csheaves,\u201d or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any\r\nhollow but the \u201cheart,\u201d or minute vertical tube formed at the axis\r\nof the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running\r\nout, infallibly take somebody\u2019s arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost\r\nprecaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will\r\nconsume almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft\r\nand then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act\r\nof coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.\r\n\n\r\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being\r\ncontinuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this; because\r\nthese twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do not\r\nstrain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and\r\nof proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks\r\nare but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like\r\ncritical ice, which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not\r\nvery much of a concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on\r\nthe American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a\r\nprodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.\r\n\n\r\nBoth ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice\r\nor loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over\r\nits edge completely disengaged from everything. This arrangement of the lower\r\nend is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening\r\nto it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale\r\nshould sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally\r\nattached to the harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted\r\nlike a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first\r\nboat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is\r\nindispensable for common safety\u2019s sake; for were the lower end of the\r\nline in any way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line\r\nout to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he\r\nwould not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down\r\nafter him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would\r\never find her again.\r\n\n\r\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft\r\nfrom the tub, and passing round the logger-head there, is again carried forward\r\nthe entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of\r\nevery man\u2019s oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also\r\npassing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to\r\nthe leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a\r\nwooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out.\r\nFrom the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed\r\ninside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\r\ncoiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a\r\nlittle further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp\u2014the rope which\r\nis immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the\r\nshort-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\r\n\n\r\nThus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils, twisting and\r\nwrithing around it in almost every direction. All the oarsmen are involved in\r\nits perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the landsman, they seem\r\nas Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their\r\nlimbs. Nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid\r\nthose hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink\r\nhim that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these\r\nhorrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\r\ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to\r\nquiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit\u2014strange thing! what cannot\r\nhabit accomplish?\u2014Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and\r\nbrighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over\r\nthe half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman\u2019s\r\nnooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men\r\ncomposing the crew pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every\r\nneck, as you may say.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated\r\nwhaling disasters\u2014some few of which are casually chronicled\u2014of this\r\nman or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost. For, when\r\nthe line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in\r\nthe midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every\r\nflying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot\r\nsit motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a\r\ncradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest\r\nwarning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of\r\nvolition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with\r\nwhere the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.\r\n\n\r\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of\r\nthe storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm\r\nis but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the\r\nseemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the\r\nexplosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about\r\nthe oarsmen before being brought into actual play\u2014this is a thing which\r\ncarries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But\r\nwhy say more? All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters\r\nround their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of\r\ndeath, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\r\nAnd if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at\r\nheart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire\r\nwith a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.CHAPTER LXI.STUBB KILLS A WHALE\n\r\nIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to Queequeg\r\nit was quite a different object.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen you see him \u2019quid,\u201d said the savage, honing his harpoon\r\nin the bow of his hoisted boat, \u201cthen you quick see him \u2019parm\r\nwhale.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to\r\nengage them, the Pequod\u2019s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep\r\ninduced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through which\r\nwe then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground; that is, it\r\naffords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious\r\ndenizens of more stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the\r\nin-shore ground off Peru.\r\n\n\r\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders leaning\r\nagainst the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an\r\nenchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all\r\nconsciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my body still\r\ncontinued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the power which first moved it\r\nis withdrawn.\r\n\n\r\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen at the\r\nmain and mizen mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last all three of us\r\nlifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we made there was a\r\nnod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their\r\nindolent crests; and across the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west,\r\nand the sun over all.\r\n\n\r\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my hands\r\ngrasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me; with a shock\r\nI came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty fathoms off, a\r\ngigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a\r\nfrigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the\r\nsun\u2019s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea,\r\nand ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet, the whale looked like a\r\nportly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale,\r\nwas thy last. As if struck by some enchanter\u2019s wand, the sleepy ship and\r\nevery sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score\r\nof voices from all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes\r\nfrom aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and\r\nregularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cClear away the boats! Luff!\u201d cried Ahab. And obeying his own\r\norder, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.\r\n\n\r\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere the\r\nboats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward, but with\r\nsuch a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam, that thinking\r\nafter all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar\r\nshould be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So seated like Ontario\r\nIndians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along;\r\nthe calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus\r\nglided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into\r\nthe air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere go flukes!\u201d was the cry, an announcement immediately\r\nfollowed by Stubb\u2019s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a\r\nrespite was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the\r\nwhale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker\u2019s boat, and much\r\nnearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honor of the\r\ncapture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of his\r\npursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles\r\nwere dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And still puffing at his pipe,\r\nStubb cheered on his crew to the assault.\r\n\n\r\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he was\r\ngoing head out; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he\r\nbrewed.[12]\n\n\n [12]\r\nIt will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire\r\ninterior of the sperm whale\u2019s enormous head consists. Though apparently\r\nthe most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him. So that with\r\nease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when going at his utmost\r\nspeed. Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head,\r\nand such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely\r\nelevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from a\r\nbluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharp-pointed New York pilot-boat.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStart her, start her, my men! Don\u2019t hurry yourselves; take plenty\r\nof time\u2014but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that\u2019s\r\nall,\u201d cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. \u201cStart\r\nher, now; give \u2019em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash,\r\nmy boy\u2014start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool\u2014cucumbers is the\r\nword\u2014easy, easy\u2014only start her like grim death and grinning devils,\r\nand raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,\r\nboys\u2014that\u2019s all. Start her!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWoo-hoo! Wa-hee!\u201d screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some\r\nold war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily\r\nbounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian\r\ngave.\r\n\n\r\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. \u201cKee-hee!\r\nKee-hee!\u201d yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,\r\nlike a pacing tiger in his cage.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKa-la! Koo-loo!\u201d howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a\r\nmouthful of Grenadier\u2019s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut\r\nthe sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his\r\nmen to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like\r\ndesperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was\r\nheard\u2014\u201cStand up, Tashtego!\u2014give it to him!\u201d The harpoon\r\nwas hurled. \u201cStern all!\u201d The oarsmen backed water; the same moment\r\nsomething went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was the\r\nmagical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns\r\nwith it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid\r\ncirclings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes\r\nfrom his pipe. As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just\r\nbefore reaching that point, it blisteringly passed through and through both of\r\nStubb\u2019s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas\r\nsometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an\r\nenemy\u2019s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time\r\nstriving to wrest it out of your clutch.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWet the line! wet the line!\u201d cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\r\nseated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed the sea-water into it.[13] More turns were\r\ntaken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now flew through the\r\nboiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego here changed\r\nplaces\u2014stem for stern\u2014a staggering business truly in that rocking\r\ncommotion.\r\n\n\n [13]\r\nPartly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated, that,\r\nin the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line with water;\r\nin many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that purpose.\r\nYour hat, however, is the most convenient.\r\n\n\r\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the\r\nboat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would have\r\nthought the craft had two keels\u2014one cleaving the water, the other the\r\nair\u2014as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once. A\r\ncontinual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake;\r\nand, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little finger, the\r\nvibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea. Thus\r\nthey rushed; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent\r\nbeing tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar\r\ncrouching almost double, in order to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole\r\nAtlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length\r\nthe whale somewhat slackened his flight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHaul in\u2014haul in!\u201d cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing\r\nround towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet\r\nthe boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly\r\nplanting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying\r\nfish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of the way of\r\nthe whale\u2019s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another fling.\r\n\n\r\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill.\r\nHis tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled and seethed\r\nfor furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing upon this crimson\r\npond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every face, so that they all\r\nglowed to each other like red men. And all the while, jet after jet of white\r\nsmoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff\r\nafter puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in\r\nupon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it\r\nagain and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again\r\nsent it into the whale.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPull up\u2014pull up!\u201d he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning\r\nwhale relaxed in his wrath. \u201cPull up!\u2014close to!\u201d and the boat\r\nranged along the fish\u2019s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb\r\nslowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully\r\nchurning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch\r\nthat the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere\r\nhe could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of\r\nthe fish. And now it is struck; for, starting from his trance into that\r\nunspeakable thing called his \u201cflurry,\u201d the monster horribly\r\nwallowed in his blood, over-wrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling\r\nspray, so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado\r\nblindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the\r\nday.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;\r\nsurging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his\r\nspout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush after\r\ngush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red wine, shot\r\ninto the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping down his motionless\r\nflanks into the sea. His heart had burst!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead, Mr. Stubb,\u201d said Daggoo.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes; both pipes smoked out!\u201d and withdrawing his own from his\r\nmouth, Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood\r\nthoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.CHAPTER LXII.THE DART\n\r\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes off\r\nfrom the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman, and\r\nthe harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar, the one known as the\r\nharpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron\r\ninto the fish; for often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement\r\nhas to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged\r\nand exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile\r\nto the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman\r\nactivity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and\r\nintrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of\r\none\u2019s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half\r\nstarted\u2014what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I\r\ncannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time. In\r\nthis straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the\r\nexhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry\u2014\u201cStand up, and give it\r\nto him!\u201d He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre\r\nhalf way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little strength may\r\nremain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the\r\nwhole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart,\r\nnot five are successful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly\r\ncursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their\r\nblood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four\r\nyears with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship owners, whaling is but a\r\nlosing concern; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if you take\r\nthe breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most\r\nwanted!\r\n\n\r\nAgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant, that is,\r\nwhen the whale starts to run, the boat-header and harpooneer likewise start to\r\nrunning fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one\r\nelse. It is then they change places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the\r\nlittle craft, takes his proper station in the bows of the boat.\r\n\n\r\nNow, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish and\r\nunnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last; he should\r\nboth dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected\r\nof him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman. I know that this\r\nwould sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase; but long\r\nexperience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in\r\nthe vast majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so\r\nmuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\r\nharpooneer that has caused them.\r\n\n\r\nTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this world\r\nmust start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of toil.CHAPTER LXIII.THE CROTCH\n\r\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in productive\r\nsubjects, grow the chapters.\r\n\n\r\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention. It is a\r\nnotched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is\r\nperpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the\r\npurpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon, whose\r\nother naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby the weapon is\r\ninstantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as\r\na backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two\r\nharpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first and second\r\nirons.\r\n\n\r\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the line;\r\nthe object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the\r\nother into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out,\r\nthe other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very\r\noften happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of\r\nthe whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the\r\nharpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron\r\ninto him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,\r\nand the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be\r\nanticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the most\r\nterrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water, it\r\naccordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a\r\npreceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.\r\nBut this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal\r\ncasualties.\r\n\n\r\nFurthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard, it\r\nthenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly curvetting about\r\nboth boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting them, and making a\r\nprodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in general, is it possible to\r\nsecure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.\r\n\n\r\nConsider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one\r\nunusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these qualities in\r\nhim, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious\r\nenterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling\r\nabout him. For, of course, each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend\r\non to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.\r\nAll these particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to\r\nelucidate several most important, however intricate passages, in scenes\r\nhereafter to be painted.CHAPTER LXIV.STUBB\u2019S SUPPER\n\r\nStubb\u2019s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm;\r\nso, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of towing\r\nthe trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms,\r\nand one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour\r\nupon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at\r\nall, except at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the\r\nenormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or\r\nwhatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will\r\ndraw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this grand\r\nargosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead in bulk.\r\n\n\r\nDarkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod\u2019s\r\nmain-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one\r\nof several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale\r\nfor a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and\r\nthen handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin, and did not\r\ncome forward again until morning.\r\n\n\r\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced his\r\ncustomary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead, some\r\nvague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in him; as if\r\nthe sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain;\r\nand though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not\r\none jot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought\r\nfrom the sound on the Pequod\u2019s decks, that all hands were preparing to\r\ncast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and\r\nthrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast\r\ncorpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the stern,\r\nand by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to\r\nthe vessel\u2019s, and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured\r\nthe spars and rigging aloft, the two\u2014ship and whale, seemed yoked\r\ntogether like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains\r\nstanding.[14]\n\n\n [14]\r\nA little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most reliable hold\r\nwhich the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes or\r\ntail; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any\r\nother (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to\r\nsink low beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from\r\nthe boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this difficulty is\r\ningeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at\r\nits outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to\r\nthe ship. By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other\r\nside of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\r\nmade to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast\r\nround the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad\r\nflukes or lobes.\r\n\n\r\nIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on\r\ndeck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual but\r\nstill good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid\r\nStarbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole\r\nmanagement of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in\r\nStubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was\r\nsomewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me\r\none from his small!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general thing,\r\nand according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray the current\r\nexpenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet\r\nnow and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for\r\nthat particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the\r\ntapering extremity of the body.\r\n\n\r\nAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns of\r\nsperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head,\r\nas if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on\r\nwhale\u2019s flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own\r\nmastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead\r\nleviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The few sleepers below in their\r\nbunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the\r\nhull, within a few inches of the sleepers\u2019 hearts. Peering over the side\r\nyou could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen,\r\nblack waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular\r\npieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the\r\nshark seems all but miraculous. How, at such an apparently unassailable\r\nsurface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part\r\nof the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale,\r\nmay best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a\r\nscrew.\r\n\n\r\nThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be\r\nseen longingly gazing up to the ship\u2019s decks, like hungry dogs round a\r\ntable where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that\r\nis tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table\r\nare thus cannibally carving each other\u2019s live meat with carving-knives\r\nall gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are\r\nquarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were\r\nyou to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the\r\nsame thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all\r\nparties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\r\ncrossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a\r\nparcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and\r\nthough one or two other like instances might be set down, touching the set\r\nterms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most\r\nhilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will\r\nfind them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than\r\naround a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whale-ship at sea. If you have\r\nnever seen that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of\r\ndevil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.\r\n\n\r\nBut, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so\r\nnigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean\r\nlips.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCook, cook!\u2014where\u2019s that old Fleece?\u201d he cried at\r\nlength, widening his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for\r\nhis supper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if\r\nstabbing with his lance; \u201ccook, you cook!\u2014sail this way,\r\ncook!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously routed from\r\nhis warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling along from his\r\ngalley, for, like many old blacks, there was something the matter with his\r\nknee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans; this old\r\nFleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping along, assisting his\r\nstep with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened\r\niron hoops; this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of\r\ncommand, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb\u2019s sideboard;\r\nwhen, with both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he\r\nbowed his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways inclining\r\nhis head, so as to bring his best ear into play.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCook,\u201d said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his\r\nmouth, \u201cdon\u2019t you think this steak is rather overdone? You\u2019ve\r\nbeen beating this steak too much, cook; it\u2019s too tender. Don\u2019t I\r\nalways say that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks\r\nnow over the side, don\u2019t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a\r\nshindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to \u2019em; tell \u2019em they\r\nare welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must keep\r\nquiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and deliver my\r\nmessage. Here, take this lantern,\u201d snatching one from his sideboard;\r\n\u201cnow then, go and preach to \u2019em!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck to the\r\nbulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the sea, so as to\r\nget a good view of his congregation, with the other hand he solemnly flourished\r\nhis tongs, and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing\r\nthe sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFellow-critters: I\u2019se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat\r\ndam noise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin\u2019 ob de lip! massa Stubb\r\nsay dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you must\r\nstop dat dam racket!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCook,\u201d here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden\r\nslap on the shoulder,\u2014\u201cCook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn\u2019t\r\nswear that way when you\u2019re preaching. That\u2019s no way to convert\r\nsinners, Cook!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho dat? Den preach to him yourself,\u201d sullenly turning to go.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Cook; go on, go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, den, Belubed fellow-critters:\u201d\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, \u201ccoax \u2019em to it;\r\ntry that,\u201d and Fleece continued.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,\r\nfellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness\u2014\u2019top dat dam slappin\u2019\r\nob de tail! How you tink to hear, \u2019spose you keep up such a dam\r\nslappin\u2019 and bitin\u2019 dare?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCook,\u201d cried Stubb, collaring him, \u201cI wont have that\r\nswearing. Talk to \u2019em gentlemanly.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOnce more the sermon proceeded.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don\u2019t blame ye so much for;\r\ndat is natur, and can\u2019t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is\r\nde pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why den you\r\nbe angel; for all angel is not\u2019ing more dan de shark well goberned. Now,\r\nlook here, bred\u2019ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a helping yourselbs from\r\ndat whale. Don\u2019t be tearin\u2019 de blubber out your neighbour\u2019s\r\nmout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale? And, by Gor,\r\nnone on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale belong to some one else. I\r\nknow some o\u2019 you has berry brig mout, brigger dan oders; but den de brig\r\nmouts sometimes has de small bellies; so dat de brigness ob de mout is not to\r\nswallar wid, but to bite off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat\r\ncan\u2019t get into de scrouge to help demselves.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell done, old Fleece!\u201d cried Stubb, \u201cthat\u2019s\r\nChristianity; go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo use goin\u2019 on; de dam willains will keep a scrougin\u2019 and\r\nslappin\u2019 each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don\u2019t hear one word; no use\r\na-preachin\u2019 to such dam g\u2019uttons as you call \u2019em, till dare\r\nbellies is full, and dare bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get em full,\r\ndey wont hear you den; for den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de\r\ncoral, and can\u2019t hear not\u2019ing at all, no more, for eber and\r\neber.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUpon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,\r\nFleece, and I\u2019ll away to my supper.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUpon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his shrill\r\nvoice, and cried\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill\r\nyour dam\u2019 bellies till dey bust\u2014and den die.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, cook,\u201d said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan;\r\n\u201cStand just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay\r\nparticular attention.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll dention,\u201d said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in\r\nthe desired position.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; \u201cI\r\nshall now go back to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are\r\nyou, cook?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat dat do wid de \u2019teak,\u201d said the old black, testily.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSilence! How old are you, cook?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Bout ninety, dey say,\u201d he gloomily muttered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd have you lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, and\r\ndon\u2019t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?\u201d rapidly bolting another\r\nmouthful at the last word, so that that morsel seemed a continuation of the\r\nquestion. \u201cWhere were you born, cook?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin\u2019 ober de\r\nRoanoke.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBorn in a ferry-boat! That\u2019s queer, too. But I want to know what\r\ncountry you were born in, cook?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I say de Roanoke country?\u201d he cried, sharply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t, cook; but I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m\r\ncoming to, cook. You must go home and be born over again; you don\u2019t know\r\nhow to cook a whale-steak yet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBress my soul, if I cook noder one,\u201d he growled, angrily, turning\r\nround to depart.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome back, cook;\u2014here, hand me those tongs;\u2014now take that\r\nbit of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be?\r\nTake it, I say\u201d\u2014holding the tongs towards him\u2014\u201ctake it,\r\nand taste it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFaintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro\r\nmuttered, \u201cBest cooked \u2019teak I eber taste; joosy, berry\r\njoosy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCook,\u201d said Stubb, squaring himself once more; \u201cdo you\r\nbelong to the church?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPassed one once in Cape-Down,\u201d said the old man sullenly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town, where\r\nyou doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved\r\nfellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here, and tell me such a\r\ndreadful lie as you did just now, eh?\u201d said Stubb. \u201cWhere do you\r\nexpect to go to, cook?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo to bed berry soon,\u201d he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAvast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It\u2019s an awful\r\nquestion. Now what\u2019s your answer?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhen dis old brack man dies,\u201d said the negro slowly, changing his\r\nwhole air and demeanor, \u201che hisself won\u2019t go nowhere; but some\r\nbressed angel will come and fetch him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch\r\nhim where?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUp dere,\u201d said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head,\r\nand keeping it there very solemnly.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you\r\nare dead? But don\u2019t you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets?\r\nMain-top, eh?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t say dat t\u2019all,\u201d said Fleece, again in the\r\nsulks.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYou said up there, didn\u2019t you, and now look yourself, and see\r\nwhere your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by\r\ncrawling through the lubber\u2019s hole, cook; but no, no, cook, you\r\ndon\u2019t get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging.\r\nIt\u2019s a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it\u2019s no go. But\r\nnone of us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye\r\nhear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t\u2019other a\u2019top of your\r\nheart, when I\u2019m giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart,\r\nthere?\u2014that\u2019s your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!\u2014that\u2019s\r\nit\u2014now you have it. Hold it there now, and pay attention.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll \u2019dention,\u201d said the old black, with both hands placed as\r\ndesired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at\r\none and the same time.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell then, cook; you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad, that\r\nI have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that, don\u2019t you?\r\nWell, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for my private table\r\nhere, the capstan, I\u2019ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by\r\noverdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live coal to it with the\r\nother; that done, dish it; d\u2019ye hear? And now to-morrow, cook, when we\r\nare cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins; have\r\nthem put in pickle. As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook.\r\nThere, now ye may go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.\r\nD\u2019ye hear? away you sail, then.\u2014Halloa! stop! make a bow before you\r\ngo.\u2014Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast\u2014don\u2019t\r\nforget.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWish, by gor! whale eat him, \u2019stead of him eat whale. I\u2019m\r\nbressed if he ain\u2019t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,\u201d\r\nmuttered the old man, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his\r\nhammock.CHAPTER LXV.THE WHALE AS A DISH\n\r\nThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and, like\r\nStubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so outlandish a\r\nthing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it.\r\n\n\r\nIt is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was\r\nesteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large prices there. Also,\r\nthat in Henry VIIIth\u2019s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a\r\nhandsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued\r\nporpoises, which, you remember, are a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are\r\nto this day considered fine eating. The meat is made into balls about the size\r\nof billiard balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for\r\nturtle-balls or veal balls. The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of\r\nthem. They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.\r\n\n\r\nThe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be\r\nconsidered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you come to\r\nsit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your\r\nappetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of\r\ncooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how they\r\nlive upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda,\r\none of their most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as\r\nbeing exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain\r\nEnglishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling\r\nvessel\u2014that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy\r\nscraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\r\nthe Dutch whalemen these scraps are called \u201cfritters;\u201d which,\r\nindeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\r\nlike old Amsterdam housewives\u2019 dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They\r\nhave such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep\r\nhis hands off.\r\n\n\r\nBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his exceeding\r\nrichness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be delicately good.\r\nLook at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo\u2019s (which\r\nis esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the\r\nspermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is; like the transparent,\r\nhalf-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet\r\nfar too rich to supply a substitute for butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen\r\nhave a method of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of\r\nit. In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to\r\ndip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile.\r\nMany a good supper have I thus made.\r\n\n\r\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish. The\r\ncasket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump, whitish\r\nlobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are then\r\nmixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat\r\nresembling calves\u2019 head, which is quite a dish among some epicures; and\r\nevery one knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining\r\nupon calves\u2019 brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own,\r\nso as to be able to tell a calf\u2019s head from their own heads; which,\r\nindeed, requires uncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young\r\nbuck with an intelligent looking calf\u2019s head before him, is somehow one\r\nof the saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at\r\nhim, with an \u201cEt tu Brute!\u201d expression.\r\n\n\r\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that\r\nlandsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that appears to\r\nresult, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned: i. e. that a man\r\nshould eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.\r\nBut no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer;\r\nperhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly\r\nwould have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the\r\nmeat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at\r\nthe long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of the\r\ncannibal\u2019s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be\r\nmore tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar\r\nagainst a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I\r\nsay, in the day of judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand,\r\nwho nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy\r\npat\u00e9-de-foie-gras.\r\n\n\r\nBut Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding\r\ninsult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized and\r\nenlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is that handle made\r\nof?\u2014what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating? And\r\nwhat do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose? With a\r\nfeather of the same fowl. And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society\r\nfor the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is\r\nonly within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to\r\npatronize nothing but steel pens.CHAPTER LXVI.THE SHARK MASSACRE\n\r\nWhen in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and weary\r\ntoil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general thing at\r\nleast, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For that\r\nbusiness is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed; and\r\nrequires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to take in\r\nall sail; lash the helm a\u2019lee; and then send every one below to his\r\nhammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time,\r\nanchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple,\r\nthe crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.\r\n\n\r\nBut sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not\r\nanswer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the\r\nmoored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch, little\r\nmore than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other parts of the\r\nocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound, their wondrous\r\nvoracity can be at times considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them\r\nup with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some\r\ninstances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity. But it was\r\nnot thus in the present case with the Pequod\u2019s sharks; though, to be\r\nsure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that\r\nnight, would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and\r\nthose sharks the maggots in it.\r\n\n\r\nNevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was\r\nconcluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on\r\ndeck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately\r\nsuspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns, so\r\nthat they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two mariners,\r\ndarting their long whaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the\r\nsharks,[15] by\r\nstriking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital\r\npart. But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the\r\nmarksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought about new\r\nrevelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not\r\nonly at each other\u2019s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round,\r\nand bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by\r\nthe same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all.\r\nIt was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort\r\nof generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and\r\nbones, after what might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and\r\nhoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor\r\nQueequeg\u2019s hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his\r\nmurderous jaw.\r\n\n\n [15]\r\nThe whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is about\r\nthe bigness of a man\u2019s spread hand; and in general shape, corresponds to\r\nthe garden implement after which it is named; only its sides are perfectly\r\nflat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower. This weapon is\r\nalways kept as sharp as possible; and when being used is occasionally honed,\r\njust like a razor. In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet\r\nlong, is inserted for a handle.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cQueequeg no care what god made him shark,\u201d said the savage,\r\nagonizingly lifting his hand up and down; \u201cwedder Fejee god or Nantucket\r\ngod; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.\u201dCHAPTER LXVII.CUTTING IN\n\r\nIt was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio professors\r\nof Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was turned into what\r\nseemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would have thought we were\r\noffering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.\r\n\n\r\nIn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous things\r\ncomprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which no single man\r\ncan possibly lift\u2014this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main-top\r\nand firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a\r\nship\u2019s deck. The end of the hawser-like rope winding through these\r\nintricacies, was then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of\r\nthe tackles was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook,\r\nweighing some one hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages\r\nover the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,\r\nbegan cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the\r\nnearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut\r\nround the hole, the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up\r\na wild chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When\r\ninstantly, the entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts\r\nlike the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers,\r\nand nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to\r\nthe whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping\r\nheave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a\r\ngreat swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the\r\ntriumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged\r\nsemicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes\r\nthe whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the\r\nbody precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the\r\nstrain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling\r\nover and over in the water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off\r\nalong the line called the \u201cscarf,\u201d simultaneously cut by the spades\r\nof Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off,\r\nand indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and\r\nhigher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass\r\nthen cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass\r\nsways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take\r\ngood heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him\r\nheadlong overboard.\r\n\n\r\nOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a\r\nboarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a\r\nconsiderable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the\r\nend of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a\r\nhold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this\r\naccomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a\r\nscientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging\r\nslicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the short lower part is\r\nstill fast, the long upper strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is\r\nall ready for lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while\r\nthe one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other\r\nis slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main\r\nhatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room.\r\nInto this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long\r\nblanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus the\r\nwork proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale\r\nand windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling,\r\nthe mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by\r\nway of assuaging the general friction.CHAPTER LXVIII.THE BLANKET\n\r\nI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of the\r\nwhale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat, and\r\nlearned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains unchanged; but it is\r\nonly an opinion.\r\n\n\r\nThe question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know what\r\nhis blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm,\r\nclose-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from\r\neight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.\r\n\n\r\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature\u2019s\r\nskin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fact\r\nthese are no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any\r\nother dense enveloping layer from the whale\u2019s body but that same blubber;\r\nand the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can\r\nthat be but the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may\r\nscrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat\r\nresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and\r\nsoft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and\r\nthickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits,\r\nwhich I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before;\r\nand being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with\r\nfancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read\r\nabout whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am\r\ndriving at here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which,\r\nI admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as\r\nthe skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were\r\nsimply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is\r\nthinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.\r\n\n\r\nAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as in\r\nthe case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one hundred\r\nbarrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or rather weight,\r\nthat oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths, and not the entire\r\nsubstance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that\r\nanimated mass, a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of\r\nliquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net\r\nweight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale\u2019s skin.\r\n\n\r\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many\r\nmarvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and\r\nre-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array, something like those\r\nin the finest Italian line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be\r\nimpressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen\r\nthrough it, as if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In\r\nsome instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\r\nveritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations. These\r\nare hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls\r\nof pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present\r\nconnexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in\r\nparticular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian\r\ncharacters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the\r\nUpper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale\r\nremains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another\r\nthing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale\r\npresents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks,\r\neffaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous\r\nrude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that\r\nthose New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the\r\nmarks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs\u2014I should\r\nsay, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this\r\nparticular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably\r\nmade by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the\r\nlarge, full-grown bulls of the species.\r\n\n\r\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale.\r\nIt has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called\r\nblanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant.\r\nFor the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or\r\ncounterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and\r\nskirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body,\r\nthat the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all\r\nseas, times, and tides. What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those\r\nshuddering, icy seas of the north, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True,\r\nother fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these,\r\nbe it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are\r\nrefrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as\r\na traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the\r\nwhale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he dies. How wonderful is\r\nit then\u2014except after explanation\u2014that this great monster, to whom\r\ncorporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he\r\nshould be found at home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters!\r\nwhere, when seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,\r\nperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found\r\nglued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by\r\nexperiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo\r\nnegro in summer.\r\n\n\r\nIt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual\r\nvitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare virtue of interior\r\nspaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after the whale! Do thou, too,\r\nremain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this world without being of it. Be\r\ncool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of\r\nSt. Peter\u2019s, and like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a\r\ntemperature of thine own.\r\n\n\r\nBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections, how few\r\nare domed like St. Peter\u2019s! of creatures, how few vast as the whale!CHAPTER LXIX.THE FUNERAL\n\r\n\u201cHaul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the\r\nbeheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue, it has\r\nnot perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it floats\r\nmore and more away, the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate\r\nsharks, and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls,\r\nwhose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale. The vast white\r\nheadless phantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that\r\nit so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls,\r\naugment the murderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship\r\nthat hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the\r\nfair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of\r\ndeath floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.\r\n\n\r\nThere\u2019s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in\r\npious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled. In life\r\nbut few of them would have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had\r\nneeded it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce. Oh,\r\nhorrible vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.\r\n\n\r\nNor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives and\r\nhovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering\r\ndiscovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls,\r\nnevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and the white\r\nspray heaving high against it; straightway the whale\u2019s unharming corpse,\r\nwith trembling fingers is set down in the log\u2014shoals, rocks, and\r\nbreakers hereabouts: beware! And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun\r\nthe place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because their\r\nleader originally leaped there when a stick was held. There\u2019s your law of\r\nprecedents; there\u2019s your utility of traditions; there\u2019s the story\r\nof your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now\r\nnot even hovering in the air! There\u2019s orthodoxy!\r\n\n\r\nThus, while in life the great whale\u2019s body may have been a real terror to\r\nhis foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world.\r\n\n\r\nAre you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than the\r\nCock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them.CHAPTER LXX.THE SPHYNX\n\r\nIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body\r\nof the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a\r\nscientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale surgeons very much\r\npride themselves; and not without reason.\r\n\n\r\nConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on the\r\ncontrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that very place, is\r\nthe thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must operate from\r\nabove, some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject, and that\r\nsubject almost hidden in a discolored, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and\r\nbursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has\r\nto cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without\r\nso much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he\r\nmust skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly\r\ndivide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do\r\nyou not marvel, then, at Stubb\u2019s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes\r\nto behead a sperm whale?\r\n\n\r\nWhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till\r\nthe body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on\r\ndeck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown leviathan this is\r\nimpossible; for the sperm whale\u2019s head embraces nearly one third of his\r\nentire bulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as that, even by the\r\nimmense tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a\r\nDutch barn in jewellers\u2019 scales.\r\n\n\r\nThe Pequod\u2019s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was\r\nhoisted against the ship\u2019s side\u2014about half way out of the sea, so\r\nthat it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And there\r\nwith the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the enormous\r\ndownward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on that side\r\nprojecting like a crane over the waves; there, that blood-dripping head hung to\r\nthe Pequod\u2019s waist like the giant Holofernes\u2019s from the girdle of\r\nJudith.\r\n\n\r\nWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went below to\r\ntheir dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck.\r\nAn intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more and more\r\nunfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.\r\n\n\r\nA short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his\r\ncabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over the side,\r\nthen slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb\u2019s long\r\nspade\u2014still remaining there after the whale\u2019s\r\ndecapitation\u2014and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended\r\nmass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood leaning over\r\nwith eyes attentively fixed on this head.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a\r\ncalm, it seemed the Sphynx\u2019s in the desert. \u201cSpeak, thou vast and\r\nvenerable head,\u201d muttered Ahab, \u201cwhich, though ungarnished with a\r\nbeard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head, and\r\ntell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast dived the\r\ndeepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has moved amid this\r\nworld\u2019s foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold\r\nhopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is\r\nballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful\r\nwater-land, there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast been where bell or\r\ndiver never went; hast slept by many a sailor\u2019s side, where sleepless\r\nmothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou saw\u2019st the locked\r\nlovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath\r\nthe exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou\r\nsaw\u2019st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck;\r\nfor hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his\r\nmurderers still sailed on unharmed\u2014while swift lightnings shivered the\r\nneighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched,\r\nlonging arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an\r\ninfidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSail ho!\u201d cried a triumphant voice from the main-masthead.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye? Well, now, that\u2019s cheering,\u201d cried Ahab, suddenly\r\nerecting himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.\r\n\u201cThat lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better\r\nman.\u2014Where away?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThree points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze to\r\nus!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBetter and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way,\r\nand to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man! how far\r\nbeyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest atom stirs or\r\nlives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind.\u201dCHAPTER LXXI.THE JEROBOAM\u2019S STORY\n\r\nHand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than the\r\nship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.\r\n\n\r\nBy and by, through the glass the stranger\u2019s boats and manned mast-heads\r\nproved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and shooting by,\r\napparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not hope to\r\nreach her. So the signal was set to see what response would be made.\r\n\n\r\nHere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of the\r\nAmerican Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals being\r\ncollected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached, every\r\ncaptain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale commanders are enabled to\r\nrecognise each other upon the ocean, even at considerable distances, and with\r\nno small facility.\r\n\n\r\nThe Pequod\u2019s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\u2019s\r\nsetting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.\r\nSquaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod\u2019s lee,\r\nand lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged\r\nby Starbuck\u2019s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in\r\nquestion waved his hand from his boat\u2019s stern in token of that proceeding\r\nbeing entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant\r\nepidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the\r\nPequod\u2019s company. For, though himself and boat\u2019s crew remained\r\nuntainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible\r\nsea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the\r\ntimid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct\r\ncontact with the Pequod.\r\n\n\r\nBut this did by no means prevent all communication. Preserving an interval of\r\nsome few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam\u2019s boat by the\r\noccasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod, as she\r\nheavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew very fresh), with her\r\nmain-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large\r\nrolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon\r\nskilfully brought to her proper bearings again. Subject to this, and other the\r\nlike interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained between the two\r\nparties; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very\r\ndifferent sort.\r\n\n\r\nPulling an oar in the Jeroboam\u2019s boat, was a man of a singular\r\nappearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make\r\nup all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his\r\nface with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted,\r\ncabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping\r\nsleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic\r\ndelirium was in his eyes.\r\n\n\r\nSo soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had\r\nexclaimed\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s he! that\u2019s he! the long-togged\r\nscaramouch the Town-Ho\u2019s company told us of!\u201d Stubb here alluded to\r\na strange story told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some\r\ntime previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account and\r\nwhat was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in question had\r\ngained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story\r\nwas this:\r\n\n\r\nHe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers,\r\nwhere he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret meetings having\r\nseveral times descended from heaven by the way of a trap-door, announcing the\r\nspeedy opening of the seventh vial, which he carried in his vest-pocket; but,\r\nwhich, instead of containing gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with\r\nlaudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna\r\nfor Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a\r\nsteady, common sense exterior and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for\r\nthe Jeroboam\u2019s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the\r\nship\u2019s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet.\r\nHe announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to\r\njump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the\r\ndeliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The\r\nunflinching earnestness with which he declared these things;\u2014the dark,\r\ndaring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural\r\nterrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the\r\nmajority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they\r\nwere afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical use in\r\nthe ship, especially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the\r\nincredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that\r\nindividual\u2019s intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the\r\narchangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials\u2014devoting the ship and\r\nall hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried out.\r\nSo strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that at last in a\r\nbody they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship,\r\nnot a man of them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan.\r\nNor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he\r\nwould; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the\r\nship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or\r\nnothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he\r\ncarried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it,\r\nwas at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good\r\npleasure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned\r\nbefore him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal\r\nhomage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous,\r\nthey are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to\r\nthe measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless power\r\nof deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to return to the\r\nPequod.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI fear not thy epidemic, man,\u201d said Ahab from the bulwarks to\r\nCaptain Mayhew, who stood in the boat\u2019s stern; \u201ccome on\r\nboard.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut now Gabriel started to his feet.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThink, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible\r\nplague!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGabriel, Gabriel!\u201d cried Captain Mayhew; \u201cthou must\r\neither\u2014\u201d But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead,\r\nand its seethings drowned all speech.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHast thou seen the White Whale?\u201d demanded Ahab, when the boat\r\ndrifted back.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThink, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible\r\ntail!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI tell thee again, Gabriel, that\u2014\u201d But again the boat tore\r\nahead as if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a\r\nsuccession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional\r\ncaprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm\r\nwhale\u2019s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it\r\nwith rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant.\r\n\n\r\nWhen this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby\r\nDick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel, whenever his\r\nname was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him.\r\n\n\r\nIt seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a\r\nwhale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick,\r\nand the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabriel\r\nsolemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the\r\nmonster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale\r\nto be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the\r\nBible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from\r\nthe mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardor to encounter him; and\r\nthe captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity,\r\ndespite all the archangel\u2019s denunciations and forewarnings, Macey\r\nsucceeded in persuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and,\r\nafter much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last\r\nsucceeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the\r\nmain-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling\r\nforth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.\r\nNow, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat\u2019s bow, and with\r\nall the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the\r\nwhale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad\r\nwhite shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily\r\ntaking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless\r\nmate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a\r\nlong arc in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty\r\nyards. Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman\u2019s\r\nhead; but the mate for ever sank.\r\n\n\r\nIt is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm-Whale\r\nFishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any. Sometimes, nothing is\r\ninjured but the man who is thus annihilated; oftener the boat\u2019s bow is\r\nknocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the headsman stands, is torn from its\r\nplace and accompanies the body. But strangest of all is the circumstance, that\r\nin more instances than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark\r\nof violence is discernible; the man being stark dead.\r\n\n\r\nThe whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried from\r\nthe ship. Raising a piercing shriek\u2014\u201cThe vial! the vial!\u201d\r\nGabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the\r\nwhale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence; because\r\nhis credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore-announced it,\r\ninstead of only making a general prophecy, which any one might have done, and\r\nso have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became\r\na nameless terror to the ship.\r\n\n\r\nMayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him, that the\r\nstranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the\r\nWhite Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab\r\nanswered\u2014\u201cAye.\u201d Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started\r\nto his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward\r\npointed finger\u2014\u201cThink, think of the blasphemer\u2014dead, and down\r\nthere!\u2014beware of the blasphemer\u2019s end!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAhab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, \u201cCaptain, I have just\r\nbethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers, if I\r\nmistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nEvery whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships, whose\r\ndelivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends upon the mere\r\nchance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most letters never reach\r\ntheir mark; and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three\r\nyears or more.\r\n\n\r\nSoon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled, damp,\r\nand covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of being kept in\r\na dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself might well have\r\nbeen the post-boy.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019st not read it?\u201d cried Ahab. \u201cGive it me, man.\r\nAye, aye it\u2019s but a dim scrawl;\u2014what\u2019s this?\u201d As he was\r\nstudying it out, Starbuck took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife\r\nslightly split the end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to\r\nthe boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, \u201cMr. Har\u2014yes, Mr.\r\nHarry\u2014(a woman\u2019s pinny hand,\u2014the man\u2019s wife, I\u2019ll\r\nwager)\u2014Aye\u2014Mr. Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;\u2014why it\u2019s\r\nMacey, and he\u2019s dead!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPoor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,\u201d sighed Mayhew;\r\n\u201cbut let me have it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNay, keep it thyself,\u201d cried Gabriel to Ahab; \u201cthou art soon\r\ngoing that way.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCurses throttle thee!\u201d yelled Ahab. \u201cCaptain Mayhew, stand\r\nby now to receive it;\u201d and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck\u2019s\r\nhands, he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the\r\nboat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat\r\ndrifted a little towards the ship\u2019s stern; so that, as if by magic, the\r\nletter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel\u2019s eager hand. He clutched it in\r\nan instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus\r\nloaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab\u2019s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked\r\nout to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that manner the\r\nmutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.\r\n\n\r\nAs, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the\r\nwhale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair.CHAPTER LXXII.THE MONKEY-ROPE\n\r\nIn the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is\r\nmuch running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here,\r\nand then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place;\r\nfor at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much\r\nthe same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now\r\nretrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in\r\nthe whale\u2019s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole\r\nthere cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass\r\nas that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my\r\nparticular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon\r\nthe monster\u2019s back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many\r\ncases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till\r\nthe whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it\r\nobserved, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts\r\noperated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the\r\npoor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as\r\nthe vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in\r\nquestion, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume\u2014a shirt and\r\nsocks\u2014in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage;\r\nand no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.\r\n\n\r\nBeing the savage\u2019s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in\r\nhis boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon\r\nhim while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale\u2019s back.\r\nYou have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so,\r\nfrom the ship\u2019s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by\r\nwhat is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong\r\nstrip of canvas belted round his waist.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed\r\nfurther, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to\r\nQueequeg\u2019s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that\r\nfor better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor\r\nQueequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honour demanded, that\r\ninstead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an\r\nelongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin\r\nbrother; nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the\r\nhempen bond entailed.\r\n\n\r\nSo strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while\r\nearnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own\r\nindividuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will\r\nhad received a mortal wound; and that another\u2019s mistake or misfortune\r\nmight plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw\r\nthat here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity\r\nnever could have so gross an injustice. And yet still further\r\npondering\u2014while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and\r\nship, which would threaten to jam him\u2014still further pondering, I say, I\r\nsaw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that\r\nbreathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion\r\nwith a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your\r\napothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may\r\nsay that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the\r\nmultitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg\u2019s\r\nmonkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very\r\nnear sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I\r\nonly had the management of one end of it.[16]\n\n\n [16]\r\nThe monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the\r\nmonkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the\r\noriginal usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford\r\nthe imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness\r\nand vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.\r\n\n\r\nI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and\r\nthe ship\u2014where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and\r\nswaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.\r\nUnappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now\r\nfreshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow\r\nfrom the carcass\u2014the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a\r\nbeehive.\r\n\n\r\nAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with\r\nhis floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted\r\nby such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark\r\nwill seldom touch a man.\r\n\n\r\nNevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous\r\nfinger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly,\r\nbesides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from\r\ntoo close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious\r\nshark\u2014he was provided with still another protection. Suspended over the\r\nside in one of the stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his\r\nhead a couple of keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks\r\nas they could reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very\r\ndisinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg\u2019s best\r\nhappiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the\r\ncircumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the\r\nblood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer\r\namputating a leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and\r\ngasping there with that great iron hook\u2014poor Queequeg, I suppose, only\r\nprayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.\r\n\n\r\nWell, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then\r\nslacked off the rope to every swell of the sea\u2014what matters it, after\r\nall? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling\r\nworld? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes;\r\nthose spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad\r\npickle and peril, poor lad.\r\n\n\r\nBut courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with\r\nblue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains\r\nand stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward\r\nadvances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him\u2014what? Some\r\nhot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinger? Do I smell ginger?\u201d suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.\r\n\u201cYes, this must be ginger,\u201d peering into the as yet untasted cup.\r\nThen standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the\r\nastonished steward slowly saying, \u201cGinger? ginger? and will you have the\r\ngoodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is\r\nginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering\r\ncannibal? Ginger!\u2014what the devil is\r\nginger?\u2014sea-coal?\u2014firewood?\u2014lucifer\r\nmatches?\u2014tinder?\u2014gunpowder?\u2014what the devil is ginger, I say,\r\nthat you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg here.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this\r\nbusiness,\u201d he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just come\r\nfrom forward. \u201cWill you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of it, if you\r\nplease.\u201d Then watching the mate\u2019s countenance, he added, \u201cThe\r\nsteward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to\r\nQueequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir?\r\nand may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the\r\nlife into a half-drowned man?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI trust not,\u201d said Starbuck, \u201cit is poor stuff\r\nenough.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye, steward,\u201d cried Stubb, \u201cwe\u2019ll teach you to\r\ndrug a harpooneer; none of your apothecary\u2019s medicine here; you want to\r\npoison us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder\r\nus all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was not me,\u201d cried Dough-Boy, \u201cit was Aunt Charity that\r\nbrought the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any\r\nspirits, but only this ginger-jub\u2014so she called it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGinger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the\r\nlockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is\r\nthe captain\u2019s orders\u2014grog for the harpooneer on a whale.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEnough,\u201d replied Starbuck, \u201conly don\u2019t hit him again,\r\nbut\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of\r\nthat sort; and this fellow\u2019s a weazel. What were you about saying,\r\nsir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of\r\ntea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was handed to\r\nQueequeg; the second was Aunt Charity\u2019s gift, and that was freely given\r\nto the waves.CHAPTER LXXIII.STUBB AND FLASK KILL A RIGHT\r\nWHALE; AND THEN HAVE A TALK OVER HIM\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale\u2019s\r\nprodigious head hanging to the Pequod\u2019s side. But we must let it continue\r\nhanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the present\r\nother matters press, and the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven\r\nthe tackles may hold.\r\n\n\r\nNow, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted into\r\na sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of\r\nthe vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed\r\nto be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands\r\ncommonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the\r\nPequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had\r\npassed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that\r\na Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all,\r\nthe announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if\r\nopportunity offered.\r\n\n\r\nNor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats,\r\nStubb\u2019s and Flask\u2019s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and\r\nfurther away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the mast-head.\r\nBut suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water,\r\nand soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An\r\ninterval passed and the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged\r\nright towards the ship by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to\r\nthe hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going\r\ndown in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared\r\nfrom view, as if diving under the keel. \u201cCut, cut!\u201d was the cry\r\nfrom the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of\r\nbeing brought with a deadly dash against the vessel\u2019s side. But having\r\nplenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they\r\npaid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their might so\r\nas to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely\r\ncritical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction,\r\nand still plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take\r\nthem under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they\r\nstuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt\r\nrunning like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath\r\nthe ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\r\nflinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on\r\nthe water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats\r\nwere free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering\r\nhis course, went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him, so\r\nthat they performed a complete circuit.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him\r\non both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round and\r\nround the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks that had\r\nbefore swum round the Sperm Whale\u2019s body, rushed to the fresh blood that\r\nwas spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did\r\nat the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock.\r\n\n\r\nAt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he turned\r\nupon his back a corpse.\r\n\n\r\nWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and in\r\nother ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation ensued\r\nbetween them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,\u201d said\r\nStubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble\r\na leviathan.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWants with it?\u201d said Flask, coiling some spare line in the\r\nboat\u2019s bow, \u201cdid you never hear that the ship which but once has a\r\nSperm Whale\u2019s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a\r\nRight Whale\u2019s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship\r\ncan never afterwards capsize?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying\r\nso, and he seems to know all about ships\u2019 charms. But I sometimes think\r\nhe\u2019ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don\u2019t half like that\r\nchap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into\r\na snake\u2019s head, Stubb?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a\r\ndark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down\r\nthere, Flask\u201d\u2014pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both\r\nhands\u2014\u201cAye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in\r\ndisguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed\r\naway on board ship? He\u2019s the devil, I say. The reason why you don\u2019t\r\nsee his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it coiled away\r\nin his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of it, he\u2019s always\r\nwanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe sleeps in his boots, don\u2019t he? He hasn\u2019t got any hammock;\r\nbut I\u2019ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo doubt, and it\u2019s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down,\r\ndo ye see, in the eye of the rigging.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the old man have so much to do with him for?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStriking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBargain?\u2014about what?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and the\r\ndevil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away his silver\r\nwatch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then he\u2019ll surrender\r\nMoby Dick.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\r\none, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old\r\nflag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and\r\ninquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the\r\ndevil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, \u2018I\r\nwant John.\u2019 \u2018What for?\u2019 says the old governor, \u2018What\r\nbusiness is that of yours,\u2019 says the devil, getting mad,\u2014\u2018I\r\nwant to use him.\u2019 \u2018Take him,\u2019 says the governor\u2014and by\r\nthe Lord, Flask, if the devil didn\u2019t give John the Asiatic cholera before\r\nhe got through with him, I\u2019ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look\r\nsharp\u2014aint you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let\u2019s\r\nget the whale alongside.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think I remember some such story as you were telling,\u201d said\r\nFlask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden\r\ntowards the ship, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember where.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThree Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did\r\nye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb,\r\ndo you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you\r\nsay is now on board the Pequod?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAm I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn\u2019t the devil\r\nlive for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any\r\nparson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to\r\nget into the admiral\u2019s cabin, don\u2019t you suppose he can crawl into a\r\nport-hole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you see that mainmast there?\u201d pointing to the ship;\r\n\u201cwell, that\u2019s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the\r\nPequod\u2019s hold, and string \u2019em along in a row with that mast, for\r\noughts, do you see; well, that wouldn\u2019t begin to be Fedallah\u2019s age.\r\nNor all the coopers in creation couldn\u2019t show hoops enough to make oughts\r\nenough.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you\r\nmeant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if he\u2019s\r\nso old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for\r\never, what good will it do to pitch him overboard\u2014tell me that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive him a good ducking, anyhow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019d crawl back.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDuck him again; and keep ducking him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSuppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though\u2014yes,\r\nand drown you\u2014what then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI should like to see him try it; I\u2019d give him such a pair of black\r\neyes that he wouldn\u2019t dare to show his face in the admiral\u2019s cabin\r\nagain for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and\r\nhereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask;\r\ndo you suppose I\u2019m afraid of the devil? Who\u2019s afraid of him, except\r\nthe old governor who daresn\u2019t catch him and put him in double-darbies, as\r\nhe deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond\r\nwith him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he\u2019d roast for him?\r\nThere\u2019s a governor!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo I suppose it? You\u2019ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going\r\nnow to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious\r\ngoing on, I\u2019ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say\u2014Look\r\nhere, Beelzebub, you don\u2019t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord\r\nI\u2019ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,\r\nand give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at\r\nthe stump\u2014do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself\r\ndocked in that queer fashion, he\u2019ll sneak off without the poor\r\nsatisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what will you do with the tail, Stubb?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDo with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;\u2014what\r\nelse?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNow, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along,\r\nStubb?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMean or not mean, here we are at the ship.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke\r\nchains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so?\u201d said Flask; \u201cyes, you\u2019ll\r\nsoon see this right whale\u2019s head hoisted up opposite that\r\nparmacetti\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn good time, Flask\u2019s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply\r\nleaned over towards the sperm whale\u2019s head, now, by the counterpoise of\r\nboth heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well\r\nbelieve. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke\u2019s head, you go over that\r\nway; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant\u2019s and you come back again;\r\nbut in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye\r\nfoolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light\r\nand right.\r\n\n\r\nIn disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the\r\nsame preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm\r\nwhale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the\r\nformer the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all\r\nthe well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece. But\r\nnothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both\r\nwhales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a\r\nmule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale\u2019s head, and ever and\r\nanon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And\r\nAhab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the\r\nParsee\u2019s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and\r\nlengthen Ahab\u2019s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were\r\nbandied among them, concerning all these passing things.CHAPTER LXXIV.THE SPERM WHALE\u2019S\r\nHEAD\u2014CONTRASTED VIEW\n\r\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join them,\r\nand lay together our own.\r\n\n\r\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are\r\nby far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly hunted by man.\r\nTo the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of\r\nthe whale. As the external difference between them is mainly observable in\r\ntheir heads; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the\r\nPequod\u2019s side; and as we may freely go from one to the other, by merely\r\nstepping across the deck:\u2014where, I should like to know, will you obtain a\r\nbetter chance to study practical cetology than here?\r\n\n\r\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these heads.\r\nBoth are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain mathematical\r\nsymmetry in the Sperm Whale\u2019s which the Right Whale\u2019s sadly lacks.\r\nThere is more character in the Sperm Whale\u2019s head. As you behold it, you\r\ninvoluntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of pervading\r\ndignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper\r\nand salt color of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and\r\nlarge experience. In short, he is what the fishermen technically call a\r\n\u201cgrey-headed whale.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads\u2014namely, the two\r\nmost important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the head,\r\nand low down, near the angle of either whale\u2019s jaw, if you narrowly\r\nsearch, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a\r\nyoung colt\u2019s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the\r\nhead.\r\n\n\r\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale\u2019s eyes, it is plain\r\nthat he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he can one\r\nexactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale\u2019s eyes corresponds\r\nto that of a man\u2019s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how it would\r\nfare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears. You would\r\nfind that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of\r\nthe straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it. If your\r\nbitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad\r\nday, you would not be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon\r\nyou from behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\r\nsame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the front\r\nof a man\u2014what, indeed, but his eyes?\r\n\n\r\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes are so\r\nplanted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to produce one\r\npicture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale\u2019s\r\neyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which\r\ntowers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys;\r\nthis, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which each independent\r\norgan imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this\r\nside, and another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be\r\nprofound darkness and nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look\r\nout on the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But\r\nwith the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct\r\nwindows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale\u2019s\r\neyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered\r\nby the reader in some subsequent scenes.\r\n\n\r\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual\r\nmatter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a hint. So long as\r\na man\u2019s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is involuntary;\r\nthat is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before\r\nhim. Nevertheless, any one\u2019s experience will teach him, that though he\r\ncan take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite\r\nimpossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two\r\nthings\u2014however large or however small\u2014at one and the same instant\r\nof time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other. But if you\r\nnow come to separate these two objects, and surround each by a circle of\r\nprofound darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in such a manner as to\r\nbring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your\r\ncontemporary consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his\r\neyes, in themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\r\ncomprehensive, combining, and subtle than man\u2019s, that he can at the same\r\nmoment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of\r\nhim, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he can, then is it as\r\nmarvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able simultaneously to go through\r\nthe demonstrations of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly\r\ninvestigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.\r\n\n\r\nIt may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\r\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by\r\nthree or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so common to\r\nsuch whales; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless\r\nperplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically opposite\r\npowers of vision must involve them.\r\n\n\r\nBut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an entire\r\nstranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for hours, and\r\nnever discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf whatever; and into the\r\nhole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it. It is\r\nlodged a little behind the eye. With respect to their ears, this important\r\ndifference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right. While the\r\near of the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and\r\nevenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from\r\nwithout.\r\n\n\r\nIs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world\r\nthrough so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller\r\nthan a hare\u2019s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel\u2019s\r\ngreat telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals; would\r\nthat make him any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing? Not at all.\u2014Why\r\nthen do you try to \u201cenlarge\u201d your mind? Subtilize it.\r\n\n\r\nLet us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant over\r\nthe sperm whale\u2019s head, so that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by\r\na ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that the\r\nbody is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might descend into\r\nthe great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us hold on here by this\r\ntooth, and look about us where we are. What a really beautiful and\r\nchaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a\r\nglistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.\r\n\n\r\nBut come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like the\r\nlong narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with a hinge at one end, instead of\r\none side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and expose its rows of\r\nteeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor\r\nwight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force. But far\r\nmore terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky\r\nwhale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet\r\nlong, hanging straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world\r\nlike a ship\u2019s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited;\r\nout of sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw\r\nhave relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to\r\nall his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.\r\n\n\r\nIn most cases this lower jaw\u2014being easily unhinged by a practised\r\nartist\u2014is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting\r\nthe ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with\r\nwhich the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles, including canes,\r\numbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.\r\n\n\r\nWith a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an anchor;\r\nand when the proper time comes\u2014some few days after the other\r\nwork\u2014Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists, are\r\nset to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances the gums; then\r\nthe jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they\r\ndrag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild\r\nwood-lands. There are generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much\r\nworn down, but undecayed; nor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is\r\nafterwards sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.CHAPTER LXXV.THE RIGHT WHALE\u2019S HEAD\u2014CONTRASTED VIEW\n\r\nCrossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale\u2019s\r\nhead.\r\n\n\r\nAs in general shape the noble Sperm Whale\u2019s head may be compared to a\r\nRoman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded); so, at\r\na broad view, the Right Whale\u2019s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance\r\nto a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager\r\nlikened its shape to that of a shoemaker\u2019s last. And in this same last or\r\nshoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very\r\ncomfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.\r\n\n\r\nBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\r\naspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and look\r\nat these two f-shaped spout-holes, you would take the whole head for an\r\nenormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its sounding-board.\r\nThen, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange, crested, comb-like\r\nincrustation on the top of the mass\u2014this green, barnacled thing, which\r\nthe Greenlanders call the \u201ccrown,\u201d and the Southern fishers the\r\n\u201cbonnet\u201d of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this, you\r\nwould take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird\u2019s nest in\r\nits crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on\r\nthis bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless, indeed,\r\nyour fancy has been fixed by the technical term \u201ccrown\u201d also\r\nbestowed upon it; in which case you will take great interest in thinking how\r\nthis mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea, whose green crown\r\nhas been put together for him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a\r\nking, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging\r\nlower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by\r\ncarpenter\u2019s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a\r\nsulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\r\n\n\r\nA great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The\r\nfissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important\r\ninterval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the beach\r\nto gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide into the\r\nmouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of\r\nan Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is\r\nabout twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a\r\nregular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us\r\nwith those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whale-bone, say\r\nthree hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the head or\r\ncrown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily\r\nmentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through\r\nwhich the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains\r\nthe small fish, when open-mouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding\r\ntime. In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order,\r\nthere are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some\r\nwhalemen calculate the creature\u2019s age, as the age of an oak by its\r\ncircular rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from\r\ndemonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probability. At any rate, if\r\nwe yield to it, we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at\r\nfirst glance will seem reasonable.\r\n\n\r\nIn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning\r\nthese blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\r\n\u201cwhiskers\u201d inside of the whale\u2019s mouth;[17] another, \u201chogs\u2019\r\nbristles;\u201d a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant\r\nlanguage: \u201cThere are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each\r\nside of his upper chop, which arch over his tongue on each side of his\r\nmouth.\u201d\r\n\n\n [17]\r\nThis reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or rather a\r\nmoustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the\r\nouter end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish\r\nexpression to his otherwise solemn countenance.\r\n\n\r\nAs every one knows, these same \u201chogs\u2019 bristles,\u201d\r\n\u201cfins,\u201d \u201cwhiskers,\u201d \u201cblinds,\u201d or whatever\r\nyou please, furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening\r\ncontrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long been on the decline.\r\nIt was in Queen Anne\u2019s time that the bone was in its glory, the\r\nfarthingale being then all the fashion. And as those ancient dames moved about\r\ngaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower,\r\nwith the like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for\r\nprotection; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.\r\n\n\r\nBut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing in the\r\nRight Whale\u2019s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these colonnades\r\nof bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you were inside the\r\ngreat Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand pipes? For a carpet to the\r\norgan we have a rug of the softest Turkey\u2014the tongue, which is glued, as\r\nit were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear\r\nin pieces in hoisting it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a\r\npassing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you\r\nabout that amount of oil.\r\n\n\r\nEre this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\r\nwith\u2014that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely\r\ndifferent heads. To sum up, then; in the Right Whale\u2019s there is no great\r\nwell of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw,\r\nlike the Sperm Whale\u2019s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those\r\nblinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again,\r\nthe Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.\r\n\n\r\nLook your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie\r\ntogether; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will not be\r\nvery long in following.\r\n\n\r\nCan you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale\u2019s there? It is the same\r\nhe died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded\r\naway. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born of a\r\nspeculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head\u2019s\r\nexpression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the\r\nvessel\u2019s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head\r\nseem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This Right\r\nWhale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have\r\ntaken up Spinoza in his latter years.CHAPTER LXXVI.THE BATTERING-RAM\n\r\nEre quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale\u2019s head, I would have you, as\r\na sensible physiologist, simply\u2014particularly remark its front aspect, in\r\nall its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate it now with the\r\nsole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of\r\nwhatever battering-ram power may be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for\r\nyou must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever\r\nremain an infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true\r\nevents, perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.\r\n\n\r\nYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the\r\nfront of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water; you\r\nobserve that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards, so as\r\nto furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like\r\nlower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the\r\nsame way, indeed, as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.\r\nMoreover you observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\r\nhas\u2014his spout hole\u2014is on the top of his head; you observe that his\r\neyes and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire\r\nlength from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of\r\nthe Sperm Whale\u2019s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or\r\ntender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider\r\nthat only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the\r\nhead, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty\r\nfeet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that\r\nthis whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon\r\nbe revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are\r\nnow to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests\r\nall that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you\r\nhow the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just\r\nso with the head; but with this difference: about the head this envelope,\r\nthough not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has\r\nnot handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the\r\nstrongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead\r\nof the Sperm Whale were paved with horses\u2019 hoofs. I do not think that any\r\nsensation lurks in it.\r\n\n\r\nBethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen chance\r\nto crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the sailors do?\r\nThey do not suspend between them, at the point of coming contact, any merely\r\nhard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large, round wad of\r\ntow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide. That bravely\r\nand uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes\r\nand iron crowbars. By itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I\r\ndrive at. But supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that\r\nas ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at\r\nwill, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I know,\r\nhas no such provision in him; considering, too, the otherwise inexplicable\r\nmanner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface, and\r\nanon swims with it high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed\r\nelasticity of its envelop; considering the unique interior of his head; it has\r\nhypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled\r\nhoneycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected\r\nconnexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension\r\nand contraction. If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might, to\r\nwhich the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes.\r\n\n\r\nNow, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall, and\r\nthis most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous\r\nlife, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is\u2014by the cord; and\r\nall obedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So that when I shall\r\nhereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency\r\neverywhere lurking in this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his\r\nmore inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all\r\nignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the Sperm\r\nWhale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic\r\nwith the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless\r\nyou own the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But\r\nclear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the\r\nchances for the provincials then? What befel the weakling youth lifting the\r\ndread goddess\u2019s veil at Lais?CHAPTER LXXVII.THE GREAT HEIDELBURGH TUN\n\r\nNow comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must know\r\nsomething of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon.\r\n\n\r\nRegarding the Sperm whale\u2019s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\r\ninclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,[18] whereof the lower is the bony\r\nstructure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an unctuous mass wholly\r\nfree from bones; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent\r\nforehead of the whale. At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide\r\nthis upper quoin, and then you have two almost equal parts, which before were\r\nnaturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.\r\n\n\n [18]\r\nQuoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics. I\r\nknow not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a solid which differs from\r\na wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side,\r\ninstead of the mutual tapering of both sides.\r\n\n\r\nThe lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of oil,\r\nformed by the crossing and re-crossing, into ten thousand infiltrated cells, of\r\ntough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The upper part, known\r\nas the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale.\r\nAnd as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the\r\nwhale\u2019s vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the\r\nemblematical adornment of his wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh\r\nwas always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish\r\nvalleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his\r\noily vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,\r\nlimpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed\r\nin any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid,\r\nyet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending\r\nforth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is just\r\nforming in water. A large whale\u2019s case generally yields about five\r\nhundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances, considerable\r\nof it is spilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in\r\nthe ticklish business of securing what you can.\r\n\n\r\nI know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated\r\nwithin, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have\r\ncompared with the silken pearl-colored membrane, like the line of a fine\r\npelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale\u2019s case.\r\n\n\r\nIt will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the\r\nentire length of the entire top of the head; and since\u2014as has been\r\nelsewhere set forth\u2014the head embraces one third of the whole length of\r\nthe creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized\r\nwhale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun, when it is\r\nlengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship\u2019s side.\r\n\n\r\nAs in decapitating the whale, the operator\u2019s instrument is brought close\r\nto the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti\r\nmagazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,\r\nuntimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its\r\ninvaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which is at\r\nlast elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the enormous\r\ncutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side, make quite a\r\nwilderness of ropes in that quarter.\r\n\n\r\nThus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and\u2014in\r\nthis particular instance\u2014almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm\r\nWhale\u2019s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.CHAPTER LXXVIII.CISTERN AND BUCKETS\n\r\nNimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect posture,\r\nruns straight out upon the overhanging main-yard-arm, to the part where it\r\nexactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a light tackle\r\ncalled a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling through a\r\nsingle-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down from the\r\nyard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a\r\nhand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops\r\nthrough the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head.\r\nThere\u2014still high elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he\r\nvivaciously cries\u2014he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people\r\nto prayers from the top of a tower. A short-handled sharp spade being sent up\r\nto him, he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the\r\nTun. In this business he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in\r\nsome old house, sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the\r\ntime this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like a\r\nwell-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other end,\r\nbeing stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert hands.\r\nThese last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom another\r\nperson has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into the bucket,\r\nTashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears;\r\nthen giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all\r\nbubbling like a dairy-maid\u2019s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its\r\nheight, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\r\nemptied into a large tub. Then re-mounting aloft, it again goes through the\r\nsame round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego\r\nhas to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun,\r\nuntil some twenty feet of the pole have gone down.\r\n\n\r\nNow, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way; several\r\ntubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a queer accident\r\nhappened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian, was so heedless and\r\nreckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled\r\ntackles suspending the head; or whether the place where he stood was so\r\ntreacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out\r\nso, without stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no\r\ntelling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came\r\nsuckingly up\u2014my God! poor Tashtego\u2014like the twin reciprocating\r\nbucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of\r\nHeidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMan overboard!\u201d cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation\r\nfirst came to his senses. \u201cSwing the bucket this way!\u201d and putting\r\none foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip\r\nitself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost before\r\nTashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a terrible\r\ntumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and\r\nheaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some\r\nmomentous idea; whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by\r\nthose struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.\r\n\n\r\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the\r\nwhip\u2014which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles\u2014a\r\nsharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one of\r\nthe two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration\r\nthe enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if\r\nsmitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now\r\ndepended, seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still\r\nmore likely from the violent motions of the head.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome down, come down!\u201d yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one\r\nhand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would\r\nstill remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed down the\r\nbucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried harpooneer should\r\ngrasp it, and so be hoisted out.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn heaven\u2019s name, man,\u201d cried Stubb, \u201care you ramming\r\nhome a cartridge there?\u2014Avast! How will that help him; jamming that\r\niron-bound bucket on top of his head? Avast, will ye!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStand clear of the tackle!\u201d cried a voice like the bursting of a\r\nrocket.\r\n\n\r\nAlmost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass dropped into\r\nthe sea, like Niagara\u2019s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly\r\nrelieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper; and all\r\ncaught their breath, as half swinging\u2014now over the sailors\u2019 heads,\r\nand now over the water\u2014Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray, was dimly\r\nbeheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego was\r\nsinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea! But hardly had the blinding\r\nvapor cleared away, when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in its hand, was\r\nfor one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash\r\nannounced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was\r\nmade to the side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed\r\nmoment, and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\r\nnow jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging\r\nperch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust\r\nupright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth\r\nfrom the grass over a grave.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBoth! both!\u2014it is both!\u201d\u2014cried Daggoo again with a\r\njoyful shout; and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one\r\nhand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the\r\nwaiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was long in\r\ncoming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\r\n\n\r\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the slowly\r\ndescending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its\r\nbottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had\r\nthrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash by\r\nthe head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was\r\npresented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might\r\noccasion great trouble;\u2014he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous\r\nheave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next\r\ntrial, he came forth in the good old way\u2014head foremost. As for the great\r\nhead itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg, the\r\ndeliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully accomplished, in\r\nthe teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments; which\r\nis a lesson by no means to be forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same\r\ncourse with fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.\r\n\n\r\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header\u2019s will be sure to seem\r\nincredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen or\r\nheard of some one\u2019s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which not\r\nseldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian\u2019s,\r\nconsidering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale\u2019s\r\nwell.\r\n\n\r\nBut, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought the\r\ntissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and most corky\r\npart about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater\r\nspecific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all, but I have ye;\r\nfor at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its\r\nlighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the\r\nwell\u2014a double welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much\r\nheavier than the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost.\r\nBut the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance\r\nmaterially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached\r\nfrom it, so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording\r\nQueequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you\r\nmay say. Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.\r\n\n\r\nNow, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious perishing;\r\nsmothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti; coffined,\r\nhearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the\r\nwhale. Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled\u2014the delicious death\r\nof an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree,\r\nfound such exceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in,\r\nso that he died embalmed. How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into\r\nPlato\u2019s honey head, and sweetly perished there?CHAPTER LXXIX.THE PRAIRE\n\r\nTo scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan;\r\nthis is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken.\r\nSuch an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have\r\nscrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted\r\na ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon. Still, in that famous work\r\nof his, Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men, but also\r\nattentively studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells\r\nin detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have\r\nGall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the\r\nphrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am\r\nbut ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of these two semi-sciences\r\nto the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.\r\n\n\r\nPhysiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He has no\r\nproper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the\r\nfeatures; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their\r\ncombined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an\r\nexternal appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the whale. For\r\nas in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is\r\ndeemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be\r\nphysiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose.\r\nDash the nose from Phidias\u2019s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\r\nNevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so\r\nstately, that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in\r\nhim is no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale\r\nwould have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round\r\nhis vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never\r\ninsulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent\r\nconceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the\r\nmightiest royal beadle on his throne.\r\n\n\r\nIn some particulars, perhaps, the most imposing physiognomical view to be had\r\nof the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect is\r\nsublime.\r\n\n\r\nIn thought, a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning.\r\nIn the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the\r\ngrand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the elephant\u2019s\r\nbrow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that great golden\r\nseal affixed by the German emperors to their decrees. It\r\nsignifies\u2014\u201cGod: done this day by my hand.\u201d But in most\r\ncreatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip of\r\nalpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which like\r\nShakespeare\u2019s or Melancthon\u2019s rise so high, and descend so low,\r\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all\r\nabove them in the forehead\u2019s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered\r\nthoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow\r\nprints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like\r\ndignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in\r\nthat full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly\r\nthan in beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one point\r\nprecisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth;\r\nno face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\r\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and\r\nships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that\r\nway viewed, its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In profile, you plainly\r\nperceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the forehead\u2019s\r\nmiddle, which, in man, is Lavater\u2019s mark of genius.\r\n\n\r\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book,\r\nspoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing nothing\r\nparticular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence. And\r\nthis reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient\r\nWorld, he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts. They deified\r\nthe crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm\r\nWhale has no tongue, or as least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable\r\nof protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure\r\nback to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone\r\nthem again in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure,\r\nexalted to Jove\u2019s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.\r\n\n\r\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no\r\nChampollion to decipher the Egypt of every man\u2019s and every being\u2019s\r\nface. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If\r\nthen, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the\r\nsimplest peasant\u2019s face, in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how\r\nmay unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm\r\nWhale\u2019s brow? I but put that brow before you. Read if it you can.CHAPTER LXXX.THE NUT\n\r\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his brain\r\nseems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.\r\n\n\r\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in\r\nlength. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the side\r\nview of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base. But in\r\nlife\u2014as we have elsewhere seen\u2014this inclined plane is angularly\r\nfilled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk\r\nand sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the\r\nmass; while under the long floor of this crater\u2014in another cavity seldom\r\nexceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth\u2014reposes the mere\r\nhandful of this monster\u2019s brain. The brain is at least twenty feet from\r\nhis apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks, like\r\nthe innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a\r\nchoice casket is it secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who\r\nperemptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable\r\nsemblance of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in\r\nstrange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems more\r\nin keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him\r\nas the seat of his intelligence.\r\n\n\r\nIt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the\r\ncreature\u2019s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true\r\nbrain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale, like all\r\nthings that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.\r\n\n\r\nIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its\r\nrear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance to the\r\nhuman skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point of view.\r\nIndeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human magnitude) among a\r\nplate of men\u2019s skulls, and you would involuntarily confound it with them;\r\nand remarking the depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological\r\nphrase you would say\u2014This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And\r\nby those negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his\r\nprodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not\r\nthe most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.\r\n\n\r\nBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale\u2019s proper brain, you\r\ndeem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea for\r\nyou. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped\u2019s spine, you will be\r\nstruck with the resemblance of its vertebr\u00e6 to a strung necklace of dwarfed\r\nskulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German\r\nconceit, that the vertebr\u00e6 are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious\r\nexternal resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive.\r\nA foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had\r\nslain, and with the vertebr\u00e6 of which he was inlaying, in a sort of\r\nbasso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the\r\nphrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their\r\ninvestigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that\r\nmuch of a man\u2019s character will be found betokened in his backbone. I\r\nwould rather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of\r\na spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in\r\nthe firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world.\r\n\n\r\nApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial cavity\r\nis continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra the bottom of\r\nthe spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight in height, and of\r\na triangular figure with the base downwards. As it passes through the remaining\r\nvertebr\u00e6 the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of\r\nlarge capacity. Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the same\r\nstrangely fibrous substance\u2014the spinal cord\u2014as the brain; and\r\ndirectly communicates with the brain. And what is still more, for many feet\r\nafter emerging from the brain\u2019s cavity, the spinal cord remains of an\r\nundecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain. Under all these\r\ncircumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale\u2019s\r\nspine phrenologically? For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative\r\nsmallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful\r\ncomparative magnitude of his spinal cord.\r\n\n\r\nBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would\r\nmerely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the sperm\r\nwhale\u2019s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the\r\nlarger vertebr\u00e6, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of\r\nit. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the organ of\r\nfirmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is\r\nindomitable, you will yet have reason to know.CHAPTER LXXXI.THE PEQUOD MEETS THE VIRGIN\n\r\nThe predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick De\r\nDeer, master, of Bremen.\r\n\n\r\nAt one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and Germans are\r\nnow among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and\r\nlongitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific.\r\n\n\r\nFor some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects. While yet\r\nsome distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a boat, her captain\r\nwas impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat has he in his hand there?\u201d cried Starbuck, pointing to\r\nsomething wavingly held by the German. \u201cImpossible!\u2014a\r\nlamp-feeder!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot that,\u201d said Stubb, \u201cno, no, it\u2019s a coffee-pot, Mr.\r\nStarbuck; he\u2019s coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman;\r\ndon\u2019t you see that big tin can there alongside of him?\u2014that\u2019s\r\nhis boiling water. Oh! he\u2019s all right, is the Yarman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGo along with you,\u201d cried Flask, \u201cit\u2019s a lamp-feeder\r\nand an oil-can. He\u2019s out of oil, and has come a-begging.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHowever curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the\r\nwhale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb\r\nabout carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens;\r\nand in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a\r\nlamp-feeder as Flask did declare.\r\n\n\r\nAs he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding what\r\nhe had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced his\r\ncomplete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the conversation to\r\nhis lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching his having to turn into\r\nhis hammock at night in profound darkness\u2014his last drop of Bremen oil\r\nbeing gone, and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency;\r\nconcluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is\r\ntechnically called a clean one (that is, an empty one), well deserving\r\nthe name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.\r\n\n\r\nHis necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his\r\nship\u2019s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the\r\nmast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that without\r\npausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and\r\nmade after the leviathan lamp-feeders.\r\n\n\r\nNow, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats that\r\nsoon followed him, had considerably the start of the Pequod\u2019s keels.\r\nThere were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were going\r\nall abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their flanks as\r\nclosely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as\r\nthough continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.\r\n\n\r\nFull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped old\r\nbull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusual\r\nyellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or\r\nsome other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed\r\nquestionable; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at\r\nall social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back\r\nwater must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\r\nmuzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet.\r\nHis spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of\r\ngush, and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean\r\ncommotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity,\r\ncausing the waters behind him to upbubble.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s got some paregoric?\u201d said Stubb, \u201che has the\r\nstomach-ache, I\u2019m afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of\r\nstomach-ache! Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It\u2019s\r\nthe first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale\r\nyaw so before? it must be, he\u2019s lost his tiller.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of\r\nfrightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this\r\nold whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on his\r\ncumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump\r\nof his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in battle, or had been born\r\nwithout it, it were hard to say.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOnly wait a bit, old chap, and I\u2019ll give ye a sling for that\r\nwounded arm,\u201d cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMind he don\u2019t sling thee with it,\u201d cried Starbuck.\r\n\u201cGive way, or the German will have him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish,\r\nbecause not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable whale, but\r\nhe was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with such great\r\nvelocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At this juncture,\r\nthe Pequod\u2019s keel had shot by the three German boats last lowered; but\r\nfrom the great start he had had, Derick\u2019s boat still led the chase,\r\nthough every moment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing they feared,\r\nwas, that from being already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart\r\nhis iron before they could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he\r\nseemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally with a\r\nderiding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe ungracious and ungrateful dog!\u201d cried Starbuck; \u201che\r\nmocks and dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes\r\nago!\u201d\u2014then in his old intense whisper\u2014\u201cgive way,\r\ngreyhounds! Dog to it!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI tell ye what it is, men\u201d\u2014cried Stubb to his\r\ncrew\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s against my religion to get mad; but I\u2019d like\r\nto eat that villanous Yarman\u2014Pull\u2014won\u2019t ye? Are ye going to\r\nlet that rascal beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the\r\nbest man. Come, why don\u2019t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who\u2019s\r\nthat been dropping an anchor overboard\u2014we don\u2019t budge an\r\ninch\u2014we\u2019re becalmed. Halloo, here\u2019s grass growing in the\r\nboat\u2019s bottom\u2014and by the Lord, the mast there\u2019s budding. This\r\nwon\u2019t do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long of it is, men,\r\nwill ye spit fire or not?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! see the suds he makes!\u201d cried Flask, dancing up and\r\ndown\u2014\u201cWhat a hump\u2014Oh, do pile on the beef\u2014lays\r\nlike a log! Oh! my lads, do spring\u2014slap-jacks and quohogs for\r\nsupper, you know, my lads\u2014baked clams and muffins\u2014oh, do,\r\ndo, spring\u2014he\u2019s a hundred barreler\u2014don\u2019t lose him\r\nnow\u2014don\u2019t oh, don\u2019t!\u2014see that Yarman\u2014Oh!\r\nwon\u2019t ye pull for your duff, my lads\u2014such a sog! such a sogger!\r\nDon\u2019t ye love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!\u2014a\r\nbank!\u2014a whole bank! The bank of England!\u2014Oh, do, do,\r\ndo!\u2014What\u2019s that Yarman about now?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the\r\nadvancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of\r\nretarding his rivals\u2019 way, and at the same time economically accelerating\r\nhis own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe unmannerly Dutch dogger!\u201d cried Stubb. \u201cPull now, men,\r\nlike fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What\r\nd\u2019ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty\r\npieces for the honor of old Gay-head? What d\u2019ye say?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI say, pull like god-dam,\u201d\u2014cried the Indian.\r\n\n\r\nFiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod\u2019s\r\nthree boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed, momentarily\r\nneared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the headsman when\r\ndrawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly, occasionally\r\nbacking the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, \u201cThere she slides,\r\nnow! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman! Sail over\r\nhim!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their\r\ngallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a righteous\r\njudgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship\r\noarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash, and\r\nwhile, in consequence, Derick\u2019s boat was nigh to capsizing, and he\r\nthundering away at his men in a mighty rage;\u2014that was a good time for\r\nStarbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards,\r\nand slantingly ranged up on the German\u2019s quarter. An instant more, and\r\nall four boats were diagonically in the whale\u2019s immediate wake, while\r\nstretching from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he made.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now going\r\nhead out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet; while\r\nhis one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to this hand, now to\r\nthat, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at every billow that he\r\nbroke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his\r\none beating fin. So have I seen a bird with clipped wing, making affrighted\r\nbroken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But\r\nthe bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but\r\nthe fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in\r\nhim; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and\r\nthis made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing\r\nbulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the\r\nstoutest man who so pitied.\r\n\n\r\nSeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod\u2019s boats\r\nthe advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to\r\nhazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last\r\nchance would for ever escape.\r\n\n\r\nBut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three\r\ntigers\u2014Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo\u2014instinctively sprang to their\r\nfeet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs; and\r\ndarted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket irons\r\nentered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and white-fire! The three boats, in\r\nthe first fury of the whale\u2019s headlong rush, bumped the German\u2019s\r\naside with such force, that both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled\r\nout, and sailed over by the three flying keels.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, my butter-boxes,\u201d cried Stubb, casting a\r\npassing glance upon them as he shot by; \u201cye\u2019ll be picked up\r\npresently\u2014all right\u2014I saw some sharks astern\u2014St.\r\nBernard\u2019s dogs, you know\u2014relieve distressed travellers. Hurrah!\r\nthis is the way to sail now. Every keel a sun-beam! Hurrah!\u2014Here we go\r\nlike three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar! This puts me in mind of\r\nfastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain\u2014makes the wheel-spokes\r\nfly, boys, when you fasten to him that way; and there\u2019s danger of being\r\npitched out too, when you strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels\r\nwhen he\u2019s going to Davy Jones\u2014all a rush down an endless inclined\r\nplane! Hurrah! this whale carries the everlasting mail!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut the monster\u2019s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\r\ntumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the\r\nloggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so\r\nfearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the\r\nlines, that using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated smoking turns\r\nwith the rope to hold on; till at last\u2014owing to the perpendicular strain\r\nfrom the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the three ropes went straight\r\ndown into the blue\u2014the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the\r\nwater, while the three sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon\r\nceasing to sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of\r\nexpending more line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though\r\nboats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this \u201cholding\r\non,\u201d as it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live\r\nflesh from the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon\r\nrising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril\r\nof the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best; for\r\nit is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken whale stays under\r\nwater, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the enormous surface of\r\nhim\u2014in a full grown sperm whale something less than square feet\u2014the\r\npressure of the water is immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric\r\nweight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how\r\nvast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred\r\nfathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. One\r\nwhaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with\r\nall their guns, and stores, and men on board.\r\n\n\r\nAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into its\r\neternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay, not so\r\nmuch as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman would have\r\nthought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the\r\nseas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular\r\nrope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three such thin\r\nthreads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day\r\nclock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of\r\nwhom it was once so triumphantly said\u2014\u201cCanst thou fill his skin\r\nwith barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth\r\nat him cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron\r\nas straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble; he\r\nlaugheth at the shaking of a spear!\u201d This the creature? this he? Oh! that\r\nunfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of a thousand\r\nthighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea,\r\nto hide him from the Pequod\u2019s fish-spears!\r\n\n\r\nIn that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent down\r\nbeneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half\r\nXerxes\u2019 army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have\r\nbeen such huge phantoms flitting over his head!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStand by, men; he stirs,\u201d cried Starbuck, as the three lines\r\nsuddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by\r\nmagnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every oarsman\r\nfelt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in a great part from the\r\ndownward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small\r\nice-field will, when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the\r\nsea.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHaul in! Haul in!\u201d cried Starbuck again; \u201che\u2019s\r\nrising.\u201d The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one\r\nhand\u2019s breadth could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung\r\nback all dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\r\nship\u2019s lengths of the hunters.\r\n\n\r\nHis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals there\r\nare certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby when wounded,\r\nthe blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions.\r\nNot so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is, to have an entire\r\nnonvalvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so\r\nsmall a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole\r\narterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\r\nwater at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from\r\nhim in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so\r\ndistant and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding\r\nand bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow,\r\nwhose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even\r\nnow, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his\r\nswaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were followed by\r\nsteady jets from the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the\r\nnatural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending\r\nits affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came,\r\nbecause no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they\r\nsignificantly call it, was untouched.\r\n\n\r\nAs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his form,\r\nwith much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed. His eyes,\r\nor rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As strange misgrown\r\nmasses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the\r\npoints which the whale\u2019s eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind\r\nbulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was none. For all his old age,\r\nand his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in\r\norder to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to\r\nilluminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all\r\nto all. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely\r\ndiscolored bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA nice spot,\u201d cried Flask; \u201cjust let me prick him there\r\nonce.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAvast!\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201cthere\u2019s no need of\r\nthat!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet\r\nshot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish,\r\nthe whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the\r\ncraft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of\r\ngore, capsizing Flask\u2019s boat and marring the bows. It was his death\r\nstroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly\r\nrolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently\r\nflapped with his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a waning\r\nworld; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It\r\nwas most piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water\r\nis gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\r\nmelancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground\u2014so\r\nthe last long dying spout of the whale.\r\n\n\r\nSoon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body showed\r\nsymptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately, by\r\nStarbuck\u2019s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so that\r\nere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches\r\nbeneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh,\r\nthe whale was transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the\r\nstiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the\r\nbody would at once sink to the bottom.\r\n\n\r\nIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the\r\nentire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on the\r\nlower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of harpoons are\r\nfrequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh\r\nperfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to denote their\r\nplace; therefore, there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the\r\npresent case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to. But still more\r\ncurious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from\r\nthe buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone\r\nlance? And when? It might have been darted by some Nor\u2019 West Indian long\r\nbefore America was discovered.\r\n\n\r\nWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there\r\nis no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by the\r\nship\u2019s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing to\r\nthe body\u2019s immensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck, who\r\nhad the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so\r\nresolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if\r\nstill persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the command was\r\ngiven to break clear from it, such was the immovable strain upon the\r\ntimber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was\r\nimpossible to cast them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To\r\ncross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof\r\nof a house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her\r\nbulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\r\ndislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the\r\nimmovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timber-heads; and so low\r\nhad the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all\r\napproached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the\r\nsinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHold on, hold on, won\u2019t ye?\u201d cried Stubb to the body,\r\n\u201cdon\u2019t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we\r\nmust do something or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your\r\nhandspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the\r\nbig chains.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cKnife? Aye, aye,\u201d cried Queequeg, and seizing the\r\ncarpenter\u2019s heavy hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to\r\niron, began slashing at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of\r\nsparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a\r\nterrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.\r\n\n\r\nNow, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a\r\nvery curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it.\r\nUsually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly\r\nconsiderably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that thus sank were\r\nold, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and\r\nall their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert\r\nthat this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\r\nsinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it is not\r\nso. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with noble\r\naspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life, with all\r\ntheir panting lard about them; even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes\r\nsink.\r\n\n\r\nBe it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident\r\nthan any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty Right Whales do.\r\nThis difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the\r\ngreater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone\r\nsometimes weighing more than a ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is\r\nwholly free. But there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or\r\nseveral days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the\r\nreason of this is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a\r\nprodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship\r\ncould hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the\r\nBays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten\r\nbuoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they\r\nknow where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.\r\n\n\r\nIt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the\r\nPequod\u2019s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her\r\nboats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the\r\nspecies of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming.\r\nNevertheless, the Fin-Back\u2019s spout is so similar to the Sperm\r\nWhale\u2019s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it. And\r\nconsequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this\r\nunnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young\r\nkeels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful\r\nchase.\r\n\n\r\nOh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.CHAPTER LXXXII.THE HONOR AND GLORY OF WHALING\n\r\nThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true\r\nmethod.\r\n\n\r\nThe more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to the\r\nvery spring-head of it, so much the more am I impressed with its great\r\nhonorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great demi-gods\r\nand heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have shed distinction\r\nupon it, I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong, though but\r\nsubordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.\r\n\n\r\nThe gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the\r\neternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by our\r\nbrotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the knightly days\r\nof our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to\r\nfill men\u2019s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and\r\nAndromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock\r\non the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off,\r\nPerseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster,\r\nand delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,\r\nrarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this\r\nLeviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite\r\nstory; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the\r\nPagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which\r\nthe city\u2019s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical\r\nbones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same\r\nskeleton was carried to Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and\r\nsuggestively important in this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set\r\nsail.\r\n\n\r\nAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda\u2014indeed, by some supposed\r\nto be indirectly derived from it\u2014is that famous story of St. George and\r\nthe Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many old\r\nchronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and often stand\r\nfor each other. \u201cThou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the\r\nsea,\u201d saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some\r\nversions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it would much subtract\r\nfrom the glory of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile\r\nof the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep. Any\r\nman may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the\r\nheart in them to march boldly up to a whale.\r\n\n\r\nLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the creature\r\nencountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a\r\ngriffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on\r\nhorseback, yet considering the great ignorance of those times, when the true\r\nform of the whale was unknown to artists; and considering that as in\r\nPerseus\u2019 case, St. George\u2019s whale might have crawled up out of the\r\nsea on the beach; and considering that the animal ridden by St. George might\r\nhave been only a large seal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will\r\nnot appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest\r\ndraughts of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no other than the great\r\nLeviathan himself. In fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this\r\nwhole story will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,\r\nDagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse\u2019s\r\nhead and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or\r\nfishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a\r\nwhaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by good rights, we\r\nharpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of St.\r\nGeorge. And therefore, let not the knights of that honorable company (none of\r\nwhom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like their great\r\npatron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with disdain, since even in our\r\nwoollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to St.\r\nGeorge\u2019s decoration than they.\r\n\n\r\nWhether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained\r\ndubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique Crockett\r\nand Kit Carson\u2014that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed\r\ndown and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman of\r\nhim, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned\r\nhis fish, unless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a\r\nsort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not\r\nthe whale. I claim him for one of our clan.\r\n\n\r\nBut, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules and\r\nthe whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story\r\nof Jonah and the whale; and vice vers\u00e2; certainly they are very similar. If I\r\nclaim the demigod then, why not the prophet?\r\n\n\r\nNor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of\r\nour order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal kings of old\r\ntimes, we find the headwaters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great\r\ngods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the\r\nShaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the\r\ngodhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our\r\nLord;\u2014Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has for\r\never set apart and sanctified the whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith\r\nthe Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical\r\ndissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the\r\nVedas, or mystical books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable\r\nto Vishnoo before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have\r\ncontained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these\r\nVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a\r\nwhale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred\r\nvolumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse\r\nis called a horseman?\r\n\n\r\nPerseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there\u2019s a member-roll\r\nfor you! What club but the whaleman\u2019s can head off like that?CHAPTER LXXXIII.JONAH HISTORICALLY REGARDED\n\r\nReference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the\r\npreceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story\r\nof Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans,\r\nwho, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the\r\nstory of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their\r\ndoubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less\r\nfacts, for all that.\r\n\n\r\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman\u2019s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\r\nstory was this:\u2014He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\r\nembellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented\r\nJonah\u2019s whale with two spouts in his head\u2014a peculiarity only true\r\nwith respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties\r\nof that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying, \u201cA penny\r\nroll would choke him;\u201d his swallow is so very small. But, to this, Bishop\r\nJebb\u2019s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary, hints the\r\nBishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale\u2019s belly, but as\r\ntemporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough\r\nin the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale\u2019s mouth would accommodate\r\na couple of whist tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too,\r\nJonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts,\r\nthe Right Whale is toothless.\r\n\n\r\nAnother reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want of\r\nfaith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to\r\nhis incarcerated body and the whale\u2019s gastric juices. But this objection\r\nlikewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah\r\nmust have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale\u2014even\r\nas the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into\r\ntents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental\r\ncommentators, that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he\r\nstraightway effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a\r\nwhale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \u201cThe\r\nWhale,\u201d as some craft are nowadays christened the \u201cShark,\u201d\r\nthe \u201cGull,\u201d the \u201cEagle.\u201d Nor have there been wanting\r\nlearned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of\r\nJonah merely meant a life-preserver\u2014an inflated bag of wind\u2014which\r\nthe endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor\r\nSag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another reason\r\nfor his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by\r\nthe whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up\r\nsomewhere within three days\u2019 journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris,\r\nvery much more than three days\u2019 journey across from the nearest point of\r\nthe Mediterranean coast. How is that?\r\n\n\r\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short\r\ndistance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way of the\r\nCape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of\r\nthe Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a\r\nsupposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three\r\ndays, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too\r\nshallow for any whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah\u2019s\r\nweathering the Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the\r\ndiscovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer,\r\nand so make modern history a liar.\r\n\n\r\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish\r\npride of reason\u2014a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he\r\nhad but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea.\r\nI say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish\r\nrebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest,\r\nthis very idea of Jonah\u2019s going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was\r\nadvanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle. And so it was.\r\nBesides, to this day, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the\r\nhistorical story of Jonah. And some three centuries ago, an English traveller\r\nin old Harris\u2019s Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of\r\nJonah, in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.CHAPTER LXXXIV.PITCHPOLING\n\r\nTo make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed; and\r\nfor much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon\r\ntheir boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as such a\r\nprocedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage;\r\nconsidering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and\r\nthat the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed\r\nstrongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship\r\nJungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;\r\ncrawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the\r\nunctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the\r\ncraft\u2019s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to some\r\nparticular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.\r\n\n\r\nTowards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them,\r\nthey turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight, as of\r\nCleopatra\u2019s barges from Actium.\r\n\n\r\nNevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb\u2019s was foremost. By great\r\nexertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the stricken\r\nwhale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal flight, with\r\nadded fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must\r\nsooner or later inevitably extract it. It became imperative to lance the flying\r\nwhale, or be content to lose him. But to haul the boat up to his flank was\r\nimpossible, he swam so fast and furious. What then remained?\r\n\n\r\nOf all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and countless\r\nsubtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced, none exceed that\r\nfine man\u0153uvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword,\r\nin all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is only indispensable with an\r\ninveterate running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance\r\nto which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking\r\nboat, under extreme headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some\r\nten or twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the\r\nharpoon, and also of a lighter material\u2014pine. It is furnished with a\r\nsmall rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled\r\nback to the hand after darting.\r\n\n\r\nBut before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the\r\nharpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom\r\ndone; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of the\r\ngreater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance,\r\nwhich in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing, therefore, you\r\nmust first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.\r\n\n\r\nLook now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\r\nequanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in\r\npitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying\r\nboat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead. Handling the\r\nlong lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be\r\nexactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one\r\nhand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed.\r\nThen holding the lance full before his waistband\u2019s middle, he levels it\r\nat the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in\r\nhis hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced\r\nupon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\r\nbalancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse,\r\nin a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers\r\nin the life spot of the whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red\r\nblood.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat drove the spigot out of him!\u201d cries Stubb. \u201c\u2019Tis\r\nJuly\u2019s immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine to-day! Would now, it\r\nwere old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,\r\nTashtego, lad, I\u2019d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we\u2019d\r\ndrink round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we\u2019d brew choice punch in the\r\nspread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the living\r\nstuff!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAgain and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated, the\r\nspear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash. The\r\nagonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is slackened, and the\r\npitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and mutely watches the monster\r\ndie.CHAPTER LXXXV.THE FOUNTAIN\n\r\nThat for six thousand years\u2014and no one knows how many millions of ages\r\nbefore\u2014the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and\r\nsprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many sprinkling\r\nor mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back, thousands of hunters\r\nshould have been close by the fountain of the whale, watching these sprinklings\r\nand spoutings\u2014that all this should be, and yet, that down to this blessed\r\nminute (fifteen and a quarter minutes past one o\u2019clock\r\nP.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.\r\n1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are, after\r\nall, really water, or nothing but vapor\u2014this is surely a noteworthy\r\nthing.\r\n\n\r\nLet us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\r\ncontingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the\r\nfinny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the\r\nelement in which they swim, hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and\r\nnever once raise its head above the surface. But owing to his marked internal\r\nstructure which gives him regular lungs, like a human being\u2019s, the whale\r\ncan only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore\r\nthe necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in\r\nany degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm\r\nWhale\u2019s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and what\r\nis still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes\r\nthrough his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.\r\n\n\r\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to\r\nvitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element, which being\r\nsubsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its\r\nvivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some\r\nsuperfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood\r\nin a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils\r\nand not fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\r\nlive without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case\r\nwith the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more\r\n(when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way\r\ninhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this?\r\nBetween his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\r\ninvolved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he\r\nquits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for\r\nan hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\r\nvitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a\r\nsurplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs. The\r\nanatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition\r\nfounded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I\r\nconsider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having\r\nhis spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If\r\nunmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for\r\na period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he\r\nstays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy\r\nbreaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy\r\nbreaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you\r\nalarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good\r\nhis regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will\r\nhe finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that in\r\ndifferent individuals these rates are different; but in any one they are alike.\r\nNow, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it\r\nbe to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is\r\nit, too, that this necessity for the whale\u2019s rising exposes him to all\r\nthe fatal hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast\r\nleviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not\r\nso much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great necessities that strike the\r\nvictory to thee!\r\n\n\r\nIn man, breathing is incessantly going on\u2014one breath only serving for two\r\nor three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to attend to,\r\nwaking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the Sperm Whale only\r\nbreathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\r\n\n\r\nIt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it\r\ncould truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I opine we\r\nshould be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in\r\nhim; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that\r\nidentical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two elements, it could not be\r\nexpected to have the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the\r\nspout\u2014whether it be water or whether it be vapor\u2014no absolute\r\ncertainty can as yet be arrived at on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that\r\nthe Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No\r\nroses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.\r\n\n\r\nFurthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal,\r\nand as that long canal\u2014like the grand Erie Canal\u2014is furnished with\r\na sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the\r\nupward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult\r\nhim by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose.\r\nBut then again, what has the whale to say? Seldom have I known any profound\r\nbeing that had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out\r\nsomething by way of getting a living. Oh! happy that the world is such an\r\nexcellent listener!\r\n\n\r\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the\r\nconveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath\r\nthe upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is\r\nvery much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the\r\nquestion returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,\r\nwhether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath,\r\nor whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\r\ndischarged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly\r\ncommunicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for\r\nthe purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because the greatest\r\nnecessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes\r\nin water. But the Sperm Whale\u2019s food is far beneath the surface, and\r\nthere he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very\r\nclosely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested,\r\nthere is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary\r\nperiods of respiration.\r\n\n\r\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have\r\nseen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from\r\nair? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things.\r\nI have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale\r\nspout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is\r\nprecisely.\r\n\n\r\nThe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and\r\nhow can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when\r\nyou are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a\r\nprodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him. And if at such times\r\nyou should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how\r\ndo you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you\r\nknow that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the\r\nspout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale\u2019s\r\nhead? For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\r\nhis elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary\u2019s in the desert; even then,\r\nthe whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing\r\nsun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.\r\n\n\r\nNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise\r\nnature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering into it, and\r\nputting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and\r\nfill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into slight contact with the\r\nouter, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often happen, your skin will\r\nfeverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it. And I know\r\none, who coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some\r\nscientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from\r\nhis cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous;\r\nthey try to evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much\r\ndoubt it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.\r\nThe wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this\r\ndeadly spout alone.\r\n\n\r\nStill, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My hypothesis\r\nis this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this\r\nconclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity\r\nand sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being,\r\ninasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or\r\nnear shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound.\r\nAnd I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such\r\nas Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a\r\ncertain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While\r\ncomposing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror\r\nbefore me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and\r\nundulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my hair,\r\nwhile plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled\r\nattic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\r\nsupposition.\r\n\n\r\nAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold him\r\nsolemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung by a\r\ncanopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that\r\nvapor\u2014as you will sometimes see it\u2014glorified by a rainbow, as if\r\nHeaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For, d\u2019ye see, rainbows\r\ndo not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the\r\nthick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot,\r\nenkindling my fog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have\r\ndoubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions.\r\nDoubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this\r\ncombination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards\r\nthem both with equal eye.CHAPTER LXXXVI.THE TAIL\n\r\nOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and the\r\nlovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I celebrate a\r\ntail.\r\n\n\r\nReckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale\u2019s tail to begin at that point of\r\nthe trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon its\r\nupper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The compact round\r\nbody of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually\r\nshoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the crotch or junction,\r\nthese flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings,\r\nleaving a wide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more\r\nexquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its\r\nutmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed\r\ntwenty feet across.\r\n\n\r\nThe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into it,\r\nand you find that three distinct strata compose it:\u2014upper, middle, and\r\nlower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those\r\nof the middle one, very short, and running crosswise between the outside\r\nlayers. This triune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the\r\ntail. To the student of old Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a\r\ncurious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone\r\nin those wonderful relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so\r\nmuch to the great strength of the masonry.\r\n\n\r\nBut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the\r\nwhole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular\r\nfibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running down\r\ninto the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute to their\r\nmight; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale\r\nseems concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to matter, this were\r\nthe thing to do it.\r\n\n\r\nNor does this\u2014its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful\r\nflexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a\r\nTitanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most appalling\r\nbeauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often\r\nbestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do\r\nwith the magic. Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the\r\nmarble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman\r\nlifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with\r\nthe massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When\r\nAngelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there.\r\nAnd whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,\r\nhermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most successfully\r\nembodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint\r\nnothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine one of submission and\r\nendurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical\r\nvirtues of his teachings.\r\n\n\r\nSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether wielded in\r\nsport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it be in, its flexions\r\nare invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no fairy\u2019s arm can\r\ntranscend it.\r\n\n\r\nFive great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\r\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping; Fourth,\r\nin lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\r\n\n\r\nFirst: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan\u2019s tail acts in a\r\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never wriggles.\r\nIn man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the whale, his tail is\r\nthe sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body, and\r\nthen rapidly sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting,\r\nleaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve\r\nto steer by.\r\n\n\r\nSecond: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights\r\nanother sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts with\r\nman, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a boat, he\r\nswiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only inflicted by the\r\nrecoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its\r\nmark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can\r\nwithstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\r\nthrough the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\r\nwhaleboat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed plank\r\nor two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most serious result.\r\nThese submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery, that they are\r\naccounted mere child\u2019s play. Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is\r\nstopped.\r\n\n\r\nThird: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the sense\r\nof touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect there is a delicacy\r\nin it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant\u2019s trunk. This\r\ndelicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly\r\ngentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from\r\nside to side upon the surface of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor\u2019s\r\nwhisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that\r\npreliminary touch! Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway\r\nbethink me of Darmonodes\u2019 elephant that so frequented the flower-market,\r\nand with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\r\nzones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess\r\nthis prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant,\r\nthat when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\r\n\n\r\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle\r\nof solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity,\r\nand kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth. But still you\r\nsee his power in his play. The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into\r\nthe air; then smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for\r\nmiles. You would almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you\r\nnoticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\r\nwould think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\r\n\n\r\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie\r\nconsiderably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of sight\r\nbeneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire\r\nflukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air, and\r\nso remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting\r\nthe sublime breach\u2014somewhere else to be described\u2014this\r\npeaking of the whale\u2019s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in\r\nall animated nature. Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems\r\nspasmodically snatching at the highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen\r\nmajestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame\r\nBaltic of Hell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you\r\nare in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah,\r\nthe archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\r\ncrimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all\r\nheading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked\r\nflukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment of adoration of\r\nthe gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers. As\r\nPtolemy Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then testified of the\r\nwhale, pronouncing him the most devout of all beings. For according to King\r\nJuba, the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their\r\ntrunks uplifted in the profoundest silence.\r\n\n\r\nThe chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant, so\r\nfar as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are\r\nconcerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality,\r\nmuch less the creatures to which they respectively belong. For as the mightiest\r\nelephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan\u2019s\r\ntail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the\r\nelephant\u2019s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the\r\nmeasureless crush and crash of the sperm whale\u2019s ponderous flukes, which\r\nin repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all\r\ntheir oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his\r\nballs.[19]\n\n\n [19]\r\nThough all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the\r\nelephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in\r\nmuch the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant;\r\nnevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious similitude; among\r\nthese is the spout. It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water\r\nor dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\r\n\n\r\nThe more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability to\r\nexpress it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would well\r\ngrace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so\r\nremarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters\r\nwho have declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale,\r\nindeed, by these methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there\r\nwanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,\r\nand unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I may,\r\nthen, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I know not\r\neven the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much more, how comprehend\r\nhis face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he\r\nseems to say, but my face shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make out\r\nhis back parts; and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no\r\nface.CHAPTER LXXXVII.THE GRAND ARMADA\n\r\nThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from the\r\nterritories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In a\r\ncontinuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra, Java,\r\nBally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or rampart,\r\nlengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and dividing the long unbroken\r\nIndian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is\r\npierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales;\r\nconspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of\r\nSunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China\r\nseas.\r\n\n\r\nThose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing midway in\r\nthat vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green promontory, known\r\nto seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to the central gateway\r\nopening into some vast walled empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth\r\nof spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand\r\nislands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of\r\nnature, that such treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least\r\nbear the appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the\r\nall-grasping western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied\r\nwith those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the\r\nMediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals\r\ndo not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless\r\nprocession of ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by\r\nday, have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with the\r\ncostliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a ceremonial like\r\nthis, they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute.\r\n\n\r\nTime out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low\r\nshaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels sailing\r\nthrough the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears.\r\nThough by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of\r\nEuropean cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat\r\nrepressed; yet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and\r\nAmerican vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and\r\npillaged.\r\n\n\r\nWith a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits; Ahab\r\npurposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and thence, cruising\r\nnorthwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm\r\nWhale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far coast of\r\nJapan, in time for the great whaling season there. By these means, the\r\ncircumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising\r\ngrounds of the world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific;\r\nwhere Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon\r\ngiving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a\r\nseason when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.\r\n\n\r\nBut how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew drink\r\nair? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the\r\ncircus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no sustenance but\r\nwhat\u2019s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other\r\nhulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves;\r\nthe world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their\r\nweapons and their wants. She has a whole lake\u2019s contents bottled in her\r\nample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable\r\npig-lead and kentledge. She carries years\u2019 water in her. Clear old prime\r\nNantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the\r\nPacific, prefers to drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off\r\nin casks, from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other\r\nships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at a score\r\nof ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain\r\nof soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So\r\nthat did you carry them the news that another flood had come; they would only\r\nanswer\u2014\u201cWell, boys, here\u2019s the ark!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java, in\r\nthe near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the ground,\r\nroundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for\r\ncruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head, the\r\nlook-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep wide awake. But though\r\nthe green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with\r\ndelighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single\r\njet was descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\r\nhereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the customary\r\ncheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of singular\r\nmagnificence saluted us.\r\n\n\r\nBut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which of\r\nlate they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales, instead of\r\nalmost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in former times, are\r\nnow frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a\r\nmultitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn\r\nsolemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this\r\naggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the\r\ncircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail\r\nfor weeks and months together, without being greeted by a single spout; and\r\nthen be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\r\n\n\r\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and forming a\r\ngreat semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a continuous chain\r\nof whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the noon-day air. Unlike the\r\nstraight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top,\r\nfalls over in two branches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the\r\nsingle forward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush\r\nof white mist, continually rising and falling away to leeward.\r\n\n\r\nSeen from the Pequod\u2019s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of\r\nthe sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air, and\r\nbeheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the thousand\r\ncheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal\r\nmorning, by some horseman on a height.\r\n\n\r\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\r\naccelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their\r\nrear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain; even so did\r\nthis vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits;\r\ngradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in one\r\nsolid, but still crescentic centre.\r\n\n\r\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling their\r\nweapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats. If\r\nthe wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits of\r\nSunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the\r\ncapture of not a few of their number. And who could tell whether, in that\r\ncongregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like\r\nthe worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So\r\nwith stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\r\nbefore us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing\r\nattention to something in our wake.\r\n\n\r\nCorresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear. It\r\nseemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something like the\r\nspouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and go; for they\r\nconstantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this\r\nsight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, \u201cAloft there, and\r\nrig whips and buckets to wet the sails;\u2014Malays, sir, and after us!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly have\r\nentered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit, to make\r\nup for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with a fresh\r\nleading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny\r\nphilanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen\r\npursuit,\u2014mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As with\r\nglass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn beholding\r\nthe monsters he chased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing\r\nhim; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he glanced upon\r\nthe green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and\r\nbethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and\r\nbeheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being\r\nchased to his deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild\r\npirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with\r\ntheir curses;\u2014when all these conceits had passed through his brain,\r\nAhab\u2019s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after\r\nsome stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing\r\nfrom its place.\r\n\n\r\nBut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when, after\r\nsteadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at last shot by\r\nthe vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging at last upon the\r\nbroad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift\r\nwhales had been gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\r\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the\r\nwhales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared\r\nthem; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But\r\nno sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale,\r\nbecome notified of the three keels that were after them,\u2014though as yet a\r\nmile in their rear,\u2014than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks\r\nand battalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked\r\nbayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\r\n\n\r\nStripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after\r\nseveral hours\u2019 pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a\r\ngeneral pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were\r\nnow at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert\r\nirresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he\r\nis gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly\r\nand steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and like\r\nKing Porus\u2019 elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed\r\ngoing mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular\r\ncircles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick\r\nspoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still\r\nmore strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed as\r\nit were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea. Had\r\nthese leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by\r\nthree fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive\r\ndismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding\r\ncreatures. Though banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned\r\nbuffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all\r\nhuman beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre\u2019s\r\npit, they will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the\r\noutlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to\r\ndeath. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales\r\nbefore us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not\r\ninfinitely outdone by the madness of men.\r\n\n\r\nThough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet it is\r\nto be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated, but\r\ncollectively remained in one place. As is customary in those cases, the boats\r\nat once separated, each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the\r\nshoal. In about three minutes\u2019 time, Queequeg\u2019s harpoon was flung;\r\nthe stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away\r\nwith us like light, steered straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a\r\nmovement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no\r\nwise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet\r\ndoes it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as\r\nthe swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid\r\nadieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\r\n\n\r\nAs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of speed to\r\nrid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we thus tore a white\r\ngash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the crazed creatures to\r\nand fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in\r\na tempest, and striving to steer through their complicated channels and\r\nstraits, knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\r\n\n\r\nBut not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from this\r\nmonster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from that, whose\r\ncolossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood up\r\nin the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could\r\nreach by short darts, for there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the\r\noarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\r\nThey chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business. \u201cOut of the\r\nway, Commodore!\u201d cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose\r\nbodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp us. \u201cHard\r\ndown with your tail, there!\u201d cried a second to another, which, close to\r\nour gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\r\n\n\r\nAll whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by the\r\nNantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal size are\r\nstoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other\u2019s grain at right\r\nangles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this\r\nblock, and the other end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be\r\nfastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is\r\nused. For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at\r\none time. But sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then,\r\nyou must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must\r\nwing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is,\r\nthat at times like these the drugg comes into requisition. Our boat was\r\nfurnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully darted,\r\nand we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous\r\nsidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors\r\nwith the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing\r\noverboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the\r\nboat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman\r\nin the boat\u2019s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the\r\nsea came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and\r\nshirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\r\n\n\r\nIt had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not that\r\nas we advanced into the herd, our whale\u2019s way greatly diminished;\r\nmoreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference of\r\ncommotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last the\r\njerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished; then, with\r\nthe tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between two whales into\r\nthe innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid\r\ninto a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the\r\noutermost whales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea\r\npresented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the\r\nsubtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were\r\nnow in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every\r\ncommotion. And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the\r\nouter concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in\r\neach, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring;\r\nand so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily\r\nhave over-arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing\r\nto the density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding\r\nthe embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present\r\nafforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in;\r\nthe wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the\r\ncentre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves;\r\nthe women and children of this routed host.\r\n\n\r\nNow, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer\r\ncircles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of\r\nthose circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the whole\r\nmultitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles. At any\r\nrate\u2014though indeed such a test at such a time might be\r\ndeceptive\u2014spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed\r\nplaying up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this circumstance,\r\nbecause, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this\r\ninnermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented\r\nthem from learning the precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so\r\nyoung, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and inexperienced; however it\r\nmay have been, these smaller whales\u2014now and then visiting our becalmed\r\nboat from the margin of the lake\u2014evinced a wondrous fearlessness and\r\nconfidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to\r\nmarvel at. Like household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our\r\ngunwales, and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\r\ndomesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their\r\nbacks with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained\r\nfrom darting it.\r\n\n\r\nBut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\r\nstranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in those\r\nwatery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales, and\r\nthose that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers. The lake,\r\nas I have hinted, was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as\r\nhuman infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast,\r\nas if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal\r\nnourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly\r\nreminiscence;\u2014even so did the young of these whales seem looking up\r\ntowards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulf-weed in their\r\nnew-born sight. Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing\r\nus. One of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a\r\nday old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in\r\ngirth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet\r\nrecovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal\r\nreticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the unborn\r\nwhale lies bent like a Tartar\u2019s bow. The delicate side-fins, and the\r\npalms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of\r\na baby\u2019s ears newly arrived from foreign parts.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLine! line!\u201d cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \u201chim\r\nfast! him fast!\u2014Who line him! Who struck? Two whale; one big, one\r\nlittle!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat ails ye, man?\u201d cried Starbuck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook-e here,\u201d said Queequeg pointing down.\r\n\n\r\nAs when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of\r\nfathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows the\r\nslackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air; so now,\r\nStarbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the\r\nyoung cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid\r\nvicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose,\r\nbecomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some\r\nof the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted\r\npond. We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.[20]\n\n\n [20]\r\nThe sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike most\r\nother fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation which may\r\nprobably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a time; though in\r\nsome few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:\u2014a contingency\r\nprovided for in suckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side of\r\nthe anus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance\r\nthese precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter\u2019s lance,\r\nthe mother\u2019s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for\r\nrods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do\r\nwell with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute\r\nmore hominum.\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and\r\naffrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly\r\nindulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and\r\ndelight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself\r\nstill for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of\r\nunwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me\r\nin eternal mildness of joy.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic spectacles\r\nin the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still engaged in\r\ndrugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly carrying on the\r\nwar within the first circle, where abundance of room and some convenient\r\nretreats were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now\r\nand then blindly darting to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at\r\nlast met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than\r\ncommonly powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering\r\nor maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\r\ncutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale\r\nwounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it\r\nseemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the\r\nharpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing\r\namong the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the\r\nbattle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.\r\n\n\r\nBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle\r\nenough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the\r\nrest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance\r\nobscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable\r\naccidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line\r\nthat he towed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while\r\nthe free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the\r\ncoils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked\r\nloose from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning through\r\nthe water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen\r\nspade about him, wounding and murdering his own comrades.\r\n\n\r\nThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary\r\nfright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a\r\nlittle, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows from\r\nafar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the submarine\r\nbridal-chambers and nurseries vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the\r\nwhales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes,\r\nthe long calm was departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like\r\nto the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\r\nSpring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre, as if\r\nto pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg\r\nchanged places; Starbuck taking the stern.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOars! Oars!\u201d he intensely whispered, seizing the\r\nhelm\u2014\u201cgripe your oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men,\r\nstand by! Shove him off, you Queequeg\u2014the whale there!\u2014prick\r\nhim!\u2014hit him! Stand up\u2014stand up, and stay so! Spring,\r\nmen\u2014pull, men; never mind their backs\u2014scrape them!\u2014scrape\r\naway!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a narrow\r\nDardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor we at last\r\nshot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly, and at the same time\r\nearnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar hair-breadth escapes,\r\nwe at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but\r\nnow crossed by random whales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky\r\nsalvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg\u2019s hat, who, while\r\nstanding in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from\r\nhis head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes\r\nclose by.\r\n\n\r\nRiotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon resolved\r\nitself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped together at\r\nlast in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight with augmented\r\nfleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still lingered in their\r\nwake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to\r\nsecure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two\r\nor three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is\r\nat hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to\r\nmark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should the\r\nboats of any other ship draw near.\r\n\n\r\nThe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying\r\nin the Fishery,\u2014the more whales the less fish. Of all the drugged whales\r\nonly one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the time, but only to\r\nbe taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft than the Pequod.CHAPTER LXXXVIII.SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLMASTERS\n\r\nThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales,\r\nand there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast\r\naggregations.\r\n\n\r\nNow, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must have been\r\nseen, even at the present day, small detached bands are occasionally observed,\r\nembracing from twenty to fifty individuals each. Such bands are known as\r\nschools. They generally are of two sorts; those composed almost entirely of\r\nfemales, and those mustering none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they\r\nare familiarly designated.\r\n\n\r\nIn cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a male of\r\nfull grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces his gallantry\r\nby falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies. In truth, this\r\ngentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about over the watery world,\r\nsurroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem. The\r\ncontrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he\r\nis always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full\r\ngrowth, are not more than one third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They\r\nare comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\r\nyards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the whole\r\nthey are hereditarily entitled to en bon point.\r\n\n\r\nIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\r\nramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely search\r\nof variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the\r\nEquatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from spending the\r\nsummer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness\r\nand warmth. By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the\r\nEquator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool\r\nseason there, and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year.\r\n\n\r\nWhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange suspicious\r\nsights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family.\r\nShould any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way, presume to draw\r\nconfidentially close to one of the ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw\r\nassails him, and chases him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young\r\nrakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss;\r\nthough do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out\r\nof his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often\r\ncause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with the\r\nwhales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with\r\ntheir long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the\r\nsupremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are\r\ncaptured having the deep scars of these encounters,\u2014furrowed heads,\r\nbroken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated\r\nmouths.\r\n\n\r\nBut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first\r\nrush of the harem\u2019s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that lord.\r\nGently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile,\r\nstill in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly\r\nworshipping among his thousand concubines. Granting other whales to be in\r\nsight, the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for\r\nthese Grand Turks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their\r\nunctuousness is small. As for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those\r\nsons and daughters must take care of themselves; at least, with only the\r\nmaternal help. For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be\r\nnamed, my Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;\r\nand so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all over the\r\nworld; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as the ardor of youth\r\ndeclines; as years and dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses;\r\nin short, as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease\r\nand virtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the\r\nimpotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem,\r\nand grown to an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the\r\nmeridians and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan\r\nfrom his amorous errors.\r\n\n\r\nNow, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is the lord\r\nand master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster. It is\r\ntherefore not in strict character, however admirably satirical, that after\r\ngoing to school himself, he should then go abroad inculcating not what he\r\nlearned there, but the folly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would very\r\nnaturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some\r\nhave surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale,\r\nmust have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a\r\ncountry-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and what\r\nwas the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils.\r\n\n\r\nThe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes\r\nhimself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales. Almost\r\nuniversally, a lone whale\u2014as a solitary Leviathan is called\u2014proves\r\nan ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no one\r\nnear him but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of\r\nwaters, and the best of wives she is, though she keeps so many moody secrets.\r\n\n\r\nThe schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously mentioned,\r\noffer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while those female whales are\r\ncharacteristically timid, the young males, or forty-barrel-bulls, as they call\r\nthem, are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans, and proverbially the\r\nmost dangerous to encounter; excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled\r\nwhales, sometimes met, and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by\r\na penal gout.\r\n\n\r\nThe Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a mob of\r\nyoung collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness, tumbling round\r\nthe world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no prudent underwriter\r\nwould insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard. They\r\nsoon relinquish this turbulence though, and when about three fourths grown,\r\nbreak up, and separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems.\r\n\n\r\nAnother point of difference between the male and female schools is still more\r\ncharacteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull\u2014poor\r\ndevil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school, and\r\nher companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering\r\nso near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.CHAPTER LXXXIX.FAST-FISH AND LOOSE-FISH\n\r\nThe allusion to the waifs and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\r\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery, of\r\nwhich the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\r\n\n\r\nIt frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a whale\r\nmay be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and captured by\r\nanother vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies,\r\nall partaking of this one grand feature. For example,\u2014after a weary and\r\nperilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by\r\nreason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a\r\nsecond whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life\r\nor line. Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between\r\nthe fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed\r\nlaw applicable to all cases.\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was\r\nthat of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A.D.\r\n1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the\r\nAmerican fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter.\r\nThey have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses\r\nJustinian\u2019s Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the\r\nSuppression of Meddling with other People\u2019s Business. Yes; these laws\r\nmight be engraven on a Queen Anne\u2019s farthing, or the barb of a harpoon,\r\nand worn round the neck, so small are they.\r\n\n\r\nI. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.\r\n\n\r\nII. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\r\n\n\r\nBut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of\r\nit, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it.\r\n\n\r\nFirst: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when it\r\nis connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all controllable\r\nby the occupant or occupants,\u2014a mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a\r\ntelegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the same. Likewise a fish is\r\ntechnically fast when it bears a waif, or any other recognised symbol of\r\npossession; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any\r\ntime to take it alongside, as well as their intention so to do.\r\n\n\r\nThese are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\r\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks\u2014the\r\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and honorable\r\nwhalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where it would be an\r\noutrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale\r\npreviously chased or killed by another party. But others are by no means so\r\nscrupulous.\r\n\n\r\nSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in\r\nEngland, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in\r\nthe Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded in\r\nharpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of their lives, obliged\r\nto forsake not only their lines, but their boat itself. Ultimately the\r\ndefendants (the crew of another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed,\r\nseized, and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And\r\nwhen those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers\r\nin the plaintiffs\u2019 teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the\r\ndeed he had done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had\r\nremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore the\r\nplaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line,\r\nharpoons, and boat.\r\n\n\r\nMr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge. In\r\nthe course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his\r\nposition, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman, after\r\nin vain trying to bridle his wife\u2019s viciousness, had at last abandoned\r\nher upon the seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of that step,\r\nhe instituted an action to recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other\r\nside; and he then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had\r\noriginally harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\r\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness, had as last abandoned her; yet\r\nabandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a\r\nsubsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent\r\ngentleman\u2019s property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found\r\nsticking in her.\r\n\n\r\nNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and\r\nthe lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\r\n\n\r\nThese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned\r\njudge in set terms decided, to wit,\u2014That as for the boat, he awarded it\r\nto the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives;\r\nbut that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they\r\nbelonged to the defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time\r\nof the final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off\r\nwith them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles; and hence\r\nanybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants\r\nafterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.\r\n\n\r\nA common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might possibly\r\nobject to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter, the two great\r\nprinciples laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted, and applied\r\nand elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws\r\ntouching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the\r\nfundamentals of all human jurisprudence; For notwithstanding its complicated\r\ntracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the\r\nPhilistines, has but two props to stand on.\r\n\n\r\nIs it not a saying in every one\u2019s mouth, Possession is half of the law:\r\nthat is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often possession\r\nis the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and\r\nRepublican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law?\r\nWhat to the rapacious landlord is the widow\u2019s last mite but a Fast-Fish?\r\nWhat is yonder undetected villain\u2019s marble mansion with a door-plate for\r\na waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the ruinous discount which\r\nMordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep\r\nWoebegone\u2019s family from starvation; what is that ruinous discount but a\r\nFast-Fish? What is the archbishop of Savesoul\u2019s income of \u00a3100,000 seized\r\nfrom the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed\r\nlaborers (all sure of heaven without any of Savesoul\u2019s help) what is that\r\nglobular 100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder\u2019s\r\nhereditary towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer,\r\nJohn Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer,\r\nBrother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not\r\nPossession the whole of the law?\r\n\n\r\nBut if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the kindred\r\ndoctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is internationally and\r\nuniversally applicable.\r\n\n\r\nWhat was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the Spanish\r\nstandard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress? What was\r\nPoland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to England? What at\r\nlast will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish.\r\n\n\r\nWhat are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish? What\r\nall men\u2019s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle of\r\nreligious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious smuggling\r\nverbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What is the great globe\r\nitself but a Loose-Fish? And what are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a\r\nFast-Fish, too?CHAPTER XC.HEADS OR TAILS\n\r\n\u201cDe balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.\u201d\r\n\n\nBracton, l. 3. c. 3.\r\n\n\r\nLatin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the\r\ncontext, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that\r\nland, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head, and the Queen\r\nbe respectfully presented with the tail. A division which, in the whale, is\r\nmuch like halving an apple; there is no intermediate remainder. Now as this\r\nlaw, under a modified form, is to this day in force in England; and as it\r\noffers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast\r\nand Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same\r\ncourteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a\r\nseparate car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first\r\nplace, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in\r\nforce, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last\r\ntwo years.\r\n\n\r\nIt seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of the\r\nCinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine\r\nwhale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore. Now the\r\nCinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of\r\npoliceman or beadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office directly from the\r\ncrown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port\r\nterritories become by assignment his. By some writers this office is called a\r\nsinecure. But not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in\r\nfobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing\r\nof them.\r\n\n\r\nNow when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their trowsers\r\nrolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat fish high and\r\ndry, promising themselves a good \u00a3150 from the precious oil and bone; and in\r\nfantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale with their cronies,\r\nupon the strength of their respective shares; up steps a very learned and most\r\nChristian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm;\r\nand laying it upon the whale\u2019s head, he says\u2014\u201cHands off! this\r\nfish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden\u2019s.\u201d\r\nUpon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation\u2014so truly\r\nEnglish\u2014knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their\r\nheads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger.\r\nBut that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the hard heart of the\r\nlearned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At length one of them, after\r\nlong scratching about for his ideas, made bold to speak.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPlease, sir, who is the Lord Warden?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe Duke.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWe have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all\r\nthat to go to the Duke\u2019s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains\r\nbut our blisters?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIs the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\r\ngetting a livelihood?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of\r\nthis whale.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt is his.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of Wellington\r\nreceived the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular lights, the case\r\nmight by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed, under the\r\ncircumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of the town respectfully\r\naddressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take the case of those\r\nunfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which my Lord Duke in\r\nsubstance replied (both letters were published) that he had already done so,\r\nand received the money, and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for\r\nthe future he (the reverend gentleman) would decline meddling with other\r\npeople\u2019s business. Is this the still militant old man, standing at the\r\ncorners of the three kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?\r\n\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the\r\nwhale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs inquire then on\r\nwhat principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right. The law\r\nitself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the reason for it. Says\r\nPlowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen, \u201cbecause of\r\nits superior excellence.\u201d And by the soundest commentators this has ever\r\nbeen held a cogent argument in such matters.\r\n\n\r\nBut why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason for\r\nthat, ye lawyers!\r\n\n\r\nIn his treatise on \u201cQueen-Gold,\u201d or Queen-pinmoney, an old\r\nKing\u2019s Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: \u201cYe tail\r\nis ye Queen\u2019s, that ye Queen\u2019s wardrobe may be supplied with ye\r\nwhalebone.\u201d Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of\r\nthe Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies\u2019 bodices. But\r\nthis same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake\r\nfor a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be presented\r\nwith a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.\r\n\n\r\nThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers\u2014the whale\r\nand the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and nominally\r\nsupplying the tenth branch of the crown\u2019s ordinary revenue. I know not\r\nthat any other author has hinted of the matter; but by inference it seems to me\r\nthat the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale, the King\r\nreceiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which,\r\nsymbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed\r\ncongeniality. And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in law.CHAPTER XCI.THE PEQUOD MEETS THE ROSE-BUD\n\r\n\u201cIn vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan,\r\ninsufferable fetor denying not inquiry.\u201d\r\n\n\nSir T. Browne, V. E.\n\n\r\nIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we were\r\nslowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the many noses on the\r\nPequod\u2019s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of\r\neyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will bet something now,\u201d said Stubb, \u201cthat somewhere\r\nhereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought\r\nthey would keel up before long.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nPresently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance lay a\r\nship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside.\r\nAs we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colors from his peak; and by\r\nthe eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped\r\naround him, it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen\r\ncall a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and\r\nso floated an unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory\r\nodor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when\r\nthe living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it\r\nregarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.\r\nYet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil\r\nobtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of\r\nthe nature of attar-of-rose.\r\n\n\r\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman had a\r\nsecond whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay\r\nthan the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those problematical whales\r\nthat seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or\r\nindigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything\r\nlike oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall see that no knowing\r\nfisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he\r\nmay shun blasted whales in general.\r\n\n\r\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\r\nrecognized his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted\r\nround the tail of one of these whales.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty fellow, now,\u201d he banteringly laughed,\r\nstanding in the ship\u2019s bows, \u201cthere\u2019s a jackal for ye! I well\r\nknow that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery;\r\nsometimes lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale\r\nspouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of\r\nboxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil\r\nthey will get won\u2019t be enough to dip the Captain\u2019s wick into; aye,\r\nwe all know these things; but look ye, here\u2019s a Crappo that is content\r\nwith our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too\r\nwith scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there. Poor\r\ndevil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let\u2019s make him a present of\r\na little oil for dear charity\u2019s sake. For what oil he\u2019ll get from\r\nthat drugged whale there, wouldn\u2019t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a\r\ncondemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I\u2019ll agree to get more\r\noil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he\u2019ll\r\nget from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain\r\nsomething worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our\r\nold man has thought of that. It\u2019s worth trying. Yes, I\u2019m for\r\nit;\u201d and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.\r\n\n\r\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or no,\r\nthe Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of escaping\r\nexcept by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his\r\nboat\u2019s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing across her bow, he\r\nperceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of\r\nher stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted\r\ngreen, and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the\r\nwhole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color. Upon her\r\nhead boards, in large gilt letters, he read \u201cBouton de\r\nRose,\u201d\u2014Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of\r\nthis aromatic ship.\r\n\n\r\nThough Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription, yet\r\nthe word rose, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently\r\nexplained the whole to him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA wooden rose-bud, eh?\u201d he cried with his hand to his nose,\r\n\u201cthat will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had to\r\npull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the blasted\r\nwhale; and so talk over it.\r\n\n\r\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\r\nbawled\u2014\u201cBouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses\r\nthat speak English?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to\r\nbe the chief-mate.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat whale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe White Whale\u2014a Sperm Whale\u2014Moby Dick, have ye seen\r\nhim?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNever heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White\r\nWhale\u2014no.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cVery good, then; good bye now, and I\u2019ll call again in a\r\nminute.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over the\r\nquarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a trumpet\r\nand shouted\u2014\u201cNo, Sir! No!\u201d Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb\r\nreturned to the Frenchman.\r\n\n\r\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains, and\r\nwas using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with your nose, there?\u201d said Stubb.\r\n\u201cBroke it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI wish it was broken, or that I didn\u2019t have any nose at\r\nall!\u201d answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he\r\nwas at very much. \u201cBut what are you holding yours for?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, nothing! It\u2019s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, aint\r\nit? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,\r\nBouton-de-Rose?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat in the devil\u2019s name do you want here?\u201d roared the\r\nGuernsey-man, flying into a sudden passion.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! keep cool\u2014cool? yes, that\u2019s the word; why don\u2019t\r\nyou pack those whales in ice while you\u2019re working at \u2019em? But\r\njoking aside, though; do you know, Rose-bud, that it\u2019s all nonsense\r\ntrying to get any oil out of such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he\r\nhasn\u2019t a gill in his whole carcase.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know that well enough; but, d\u2019ye see, the Captain here\r\nwon\u2019t believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer\r\nbefore. But come aboard, and mayhap he\u2019ll believe you, if he won\u2019t\r\nme; and so I\u2019ll get out of this dirty scrape.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\u201d rejoined\r\nStubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented\r\nitself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy\r\ntackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked\r\nvery fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses upwardly\r\nprojected from their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them\r\nwould drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some\r\nthinking they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at\r\nintervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their\r\npipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so\r\nthat it constantly filled their olfactories.\r\n\n\r\nStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the\r\nCaptain\u2019s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a fiery\r\nface thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This was the\r\ntormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of\r\nthe day, had betaken himself to the Captain\u2019s round-house (cabinet\r\nhe called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help yelling out his\r\nentreaties and indignations at times.\r\n\n\r\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\r\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\r\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had\r\nbrought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him\r\ncarefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest\r\nsuspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace on that head,\r\nbut otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two\r\nquickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\r\nCaptain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According\r\nto this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an\r\ninterpreter\u2019s office, was to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as\r\ncoming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should\r\ncome uppermost in him during the interview.\r\n\n\r\nBy this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small and\r\ndark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with large whiskers\r\nand moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at\r\nhis side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely introduced by the\r\nGuernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting\r\nbetween them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat shall I say to him first?\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,\r\n\u201cyou may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to\r\nme, though I don\u2019t pretend to be a judge.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe says, Monsieur,\u201d said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to\r\nhis captain, \u201cthat only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\r\nand chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a blasted\r\nwhale they had brought alongside.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUpon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\r\ncarefully, I\u2019m quite certain that he\u2019s no more fit to command a\r\nwhale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he\u2019s a\r\nbaboon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is\r\nfar more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us, as we\r\nvalue our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nInstantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew to\r\ndesist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the cables and\r\nchains confining the whales to the ship.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d said the Guernsey-man, when the captain had returned to\r\nthem.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now\r\nthat\u2014that\u2014in fact, tell him I\u2019ve diddled him, and (aside to\r\nhimself) perhaps somebody else.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe says, Monsieur, that he\u2019s very happy to have been of any\r\nservice to us.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties (meaning\r\nhimself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink\r\na bottle of Bordeaux.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\u201d said the\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank him heartily; but tell him it\u2019s against my principles to\r\ndrink with the man I\u2019ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe says, Monsieur, that his principles won\u2019t admit of his\r\ndrinking; but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then\r\nMonsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these\r\nwhales, for it\u2019s so calm they won\u2019t drift.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBy this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed the\r\nGuernsey-man to this effect,\u2014that having a long tow-line in his boat, he\r\nwould do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter whale of the\r\ntwo from the ship\u2019s side. While the Frenchman\u2019s boats, then, were\r\nengaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale\r\nthe other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\r\n\n\r\nPresently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\r\nhoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the Pequod\r\nslid in between him and Stubb\u2019s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to\r\nthe floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions, at\r\nonce proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp\r\nboat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the body, a little behind the side\r\nfin. You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea;\r\nand when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning\r\nup old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat\u2019s\r\ncrew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as\r\nanxious as gold-hunters.\r\n\n\r\nAnd all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming, and\r\nyelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look disappointed,\r\nespecially as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly from out the very\r\nheart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed\r\nthrough the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will\r\nflow into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for a\r\ntime.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have it, I have it,\u201d cried Stubb, with delight, striking\r\nsomething in the subterranean regions, \u201ca purse! a purse!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of something\r\nthat looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese; very unctuous\r\nand savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue\r\nbetween yellow and ash color. And this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a\r\ngold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more\r\nwas unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been\r\nsecured were it not for impatient Ahab\u2019s loud command to Stubb to desist,\r\nand come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.CHAPTER XCII.AMBERGRIS\n\r\nNow this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an article\r\nof commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin was examined\r\nat the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject. For at that time,\r\nand indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris\r\nremained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned. Though the word\r\nambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are\r\nquite distinct. For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug\r\nup in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the\r\nsea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used\r\nfor mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft,\r\nwaxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery,\r\nin pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in\r\ncooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is\r\ncarried to St. Peter\u2019s in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains\r\ninto claret, to flavor it.\r\n\n\r\nWho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale\r\nthemselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale! Yet\r\nso it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and by others the\r\neffect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a dyspepsia it were\r\nhard to say, unless by administering three or four boat loads of\r\nBrandreth\u2019s pills, and then running out of harm\u2019s way, as laborers\r\ndo in blasting rocks.\r\n\n\r\nI have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain hard,\r\nround, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors\u2019\r\ntrousers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than\r\npieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\r\n\n\r\nNow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in\r\nthe heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that saying of St.\r\nPaul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption; how that we are sown in\r\ndishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that saying of\r\nParacelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also forget not the\r\nstrange fact that of all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental\r\nmanufacturing stages, is the worst.\r\n\n\r\nI should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot, owing\r\nto my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and which, in the\r\nestimation of some already biased minds, might be considered as indirectly\r\nsubstantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman\u2019s two whales.\r\nElsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the\r\nvocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is\r\nanother thing to rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did\r\nthis odious stigma originate?\r\n\n\r\nI opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland\r\nwhaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because those whalemen\r\ndid not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships\r\nhave always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it\r\nthrough the bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the\r\nshortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to\r\nwhich they are exposed, forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that\r\nupon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in\r\nthe Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising\r\nfrom excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in\r\nHospital.\r\n\n\r\nI partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise\r\nimputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former times, of a Dutch\r\nvillage called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used\r\nby the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a textbook on that\r\nsubject. As its name imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was\r\nfounded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\r\nbe tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\r\ncollection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in\r\nfull operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is\r\nquite different from a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years\r\nperhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\r\nfifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it is casked,\r\nthe oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently\r\ntreated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can\r\nwhalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a\r\nJew in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise\r\nthan fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\r\nabundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the\r\nopen air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale\u2019s flukes above water\r\ndispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm\r\nparlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering\r\nhis magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and\r\nredolent with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to\r\nAlexander the Great?CHAPTER XCIII.THE CASTAWAY\n\r\nIt was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most\r\nsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod\u2019s crew; an\r\nevent most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry\r\nand predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of\r\nwhatever shattered sequel might prove her own.\r\n\n\r\nNow, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some few\r\nhands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work the vessel\r\nwhile the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing, these ship-keepers\r\nare as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats\u2019 crews. But if there\r\nhappen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that\r\nwight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the\r\nlittle negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard\r\nof him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so\r\ngloomy-jolly.\r\n\n\r\nIn outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a white\r\none, of equal developments, though of dissimilar color, driven in one eccentric\r\nspan. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his\r\nintellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with\r\nthat pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which\r\never enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other\r\nrace. For blacks, the year\u2019s calendar should show naught but three\r\nhundred and sixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year\u2019s Days. Nor smile so,\r\nwhile I write that this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its\r\nbrilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king\u2019s cabinets. But\r\nPip loved life, and all life\u2019s peaceable securities; so that the\r\npanic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped,\r\nhad most sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what\r\nwas thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly\r\nillumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times\r\nthe natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in Connecticut, he\r\nhad once enlivened many a fiddler\u2019s frolic on the green; and at melodious\r\neven-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned the round horizon into one\r\nstar-belled tambourine. So, though in the clear air of day, suspended against a\r\nblue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when\r\nthe cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre,\r\nhe lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but\r\nby some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences, infernally\r\nsuperb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the crystal\r\nskies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to\r\nthe story.\r\n\n\r\nIt came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb\u2019s after-oarsman\r\nchanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and,\r\ntemporarily, Pip was put into his place.\r\n\n\r\nThe first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but\r\nhappily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and therefore\r\ncame off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing him, took care,\r\nafterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost, for he\r\nmight often find it needful.\r\n\n\r\nNow upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the fish\r\nreceived the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this\r\ninstance, to be right under poor Pip\u2019s seat. The involuntary\r\nconsternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the\r\nboat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against his\r\nchest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when\r\nat last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale started on a\r\nfierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all\r\nfoaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line,\r\nwhich had taken several turns around his chest and neck.\r\n\n\r\nTashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated Pip\r\nfor a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended its\r\nsharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively,\r\ncut? Meantime Pip\u2019s blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God\u2019s\r\nsake! All passed in a flash. In less than half a minute, this entire thing\r\nhappened.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDamn him, cut!\u201d roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip\r\nwas saved.\r\n\n\r\nSo soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by yells\r\nand execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings\r\nto evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still half humorous\r\nmanner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially gave him much\r\nwholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip,\r\nexcept\u2014but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is.\r\nNow, in general, Stick to the boat, is your true motto in whaling; but\r\ncases will sometimes happen when Leap from the boat, is still better.\r\nMoreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted\r\nconscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump\r\nin for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and concluded with a\r\nperemptory command, \u201cStick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I wont pick\r\nyou up if you jump; mind that. We can\u2019t afford to lose whales by the\r\nlikes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in\r\nAlabama. Bear that in mind, and don\u2019t jump any more.\u201d Hereby\r\nperhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a\r\nmoney-making animal, which propensity too often interferes with his\r\nbenevolence.\r\n\n\r\nBut we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was under\r\nvery similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time he did not\r\nbreast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left\r\nbehind on the sea, like a hurried traveller\u2019s trunk. Alas! Stubb was but\r\ntoo true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea\r\ncalm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like\r\ngold-beater\u2019s skin hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in\r\nthat sea, Pip\u2019s ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was\r\nlifted when he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb\u2019s inexorable back was turned\r\nupon him; and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless\r\nocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip\r\nturned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway,\r\nthough the loftiest and the brightest.\r\n\n\r\nNow, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised\r\nswimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful lonesomeness is\r\nintolerable. The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a\r\nheartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how when sailors in a dead\r\ncalm bathe in the open sea\u2014mark how closely they hug their ship and only\r\ncoast along her sides.\r\n\n\r\nBut had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he did\r\nnot mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and he\r\nsupposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly, and\r\npick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized\r\nthrough their own timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all\r\nsimilar instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost invariably\r\nin the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the same ruthless\r\ndetestation peculiar to military navies and armies.\r\n\n\r\nBut it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying\r\nwhales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb\u2019s\r\nboat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that\r\nPip\u2019s ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest\r\nchance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little negro\r\nwent about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The sea had\r\njeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not\r\ndrowned entirely, though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where\r\nstrange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his\r\npassive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and\r\namong the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the\r\nmultitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of\r\nwaters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God\u2019s foot upon the treadle of\r\nthe loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So\r\nman\u2019s insanity is heaven\u2019s sense; and wandering from all mortal\r\nreason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is\r\nabsurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as\r\nhis God.\r\n\n\r\nFor the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that fishery;\r\nand in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonment\r\nbefell myself.CHAPTER XCIV.A SQUEEZE OF THE HAND\n\r\nThat whale of Stubb\u2019s so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the\r\nPequod\u2019s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously\r\ndetailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of the Heidelburgh\r\nTun, or Case.\r\n\n\r\nWhile some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in\r\ndragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and when the\r\nproper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the\r\ntry-works, of which anon.\r\n\n\r\nIt had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several\r\nothers, I sat down before a large Constantine\u2019s bath of it, I found it\r\nstrangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the liquid\r\npart. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid. A sweet and\r\nunctuous duty! no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favorite\r\ncosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious\r\nmollifier! After having my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt\r\nlike eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine and spiralize.\r\n\n\r\nAs I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter exertion\r\nat the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under indolent sail, and\r\ngliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among those soft, gentle\r\nglobules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within the hour; as they richly\r\nbroke to my fingers, and discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes\r\ntheir wine; as I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,\u2014literally and\r\ntruly, like the smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I\r\nlived as in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that\r\ninexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to\r\ncredit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying\r\nthe heat of anger: while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all\r\nill-will, or petulence, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.\r\n\n\r\nSqueeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I\r\nmyself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of\r\ninsanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my\r\nco-laborers\u2019 hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules.\r\nSuch an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation\r\nbeget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up\r\ninto their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,\u2014Oh! my dear fellow\r\nbeings, why should we longer cherish any social acerbities, or know the\r\nslightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us\r\nall squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally\r\ninto the very milk and sperm of kindness.\r\n\n\r\nWould that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by many\r\nprolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases man must\r\neventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity; not\r\nplacing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart,\r\nthe bed, the table, the saddle, the fire-side, the country; now that I have\r\nperceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the\r\nvisions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his\r\nhands in a jar of spermaceti.\r\n\n\r\nNow, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things akin to\r\nit, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works.\r\n\n\r\nFirst comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering part of\r\nthe fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is tough with\r\ncongealed tendons\u2014a wad of muscle\u2014but still contains some oil.\r\nAfter being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable\r\noblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like blocks of Berkshire\r\nmarble.\r\n\n\r\nPlum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the\r\nwhale\u2019s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and\r\noften participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a most\r\nrefreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name imports, it is\r\nof an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked snowy and golden\r\nground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of\r\nrubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself\r\nfrom eating it. I confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it. It\r\ntasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le\r\nGros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after\r\nthe venison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an\r\nunusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.\r\n\n\r\nThere is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the\r\ncourse of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to\r\ndescribe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original with the whalemen,\r\nand even so is the nature of the substance. It is an ineffably oozy, stringy\r\naffair, most frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged\r\nsqueezing, and subsequent decanting. I hold it to be the wondrously thin,\r\nruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.\r\n\n\r\nGurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but sometimes\r\nincidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the dark, glutinous\r\nsubstance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale, and\r\nmuch of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble\r\nLeviathan.\r\n\n\r\nNippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale\u2019s vocabulary.\r\nBut as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman\u2019s nipper is a short\r\nfirm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan\u2019s\r\ntail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of\r\nthe iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like a\r\nleathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along\r\nwith it all impurities.\r\n\n\r\nBut to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once to\r\ndescend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates. This\r\nplace has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces,\r\nwhen stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper time arrives for\r\ncutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros,\r\nespecially by night. On one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left\r\nclear for the workmen. They generally go in pairs,\u2014a pike-and-gaff-man\r\nand a spade-man. The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate\u2019s\r\nboarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With\r\nhis gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it\r\nfrom slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man\r\nstands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable\r\nhorse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan\u2019s\r\nfeet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide\r\naway from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his\r\nassistants\u2019, would you be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among\r\nveteran blubber-room men.CHAPTER XCV.THE CASSOCK\n\r\nHad you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this\r\npost-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass,\r\npretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very\r\nstrange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen there, lying along\r\nlengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous cistern in the whale\u2019s\r\nhuge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his\r\nsymmetrical tail; none of these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of\r\nthat unaccountable cone,\u2014longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in\r\ndiameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an\r\nidol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol\r\nas that found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for\r\nworshipping which, king Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol,\r\nand burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the\r\n15th chapter of the first book of Kings.\r\n\n\r\nLook at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted by two\r\nallies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it, and with bowed\r\nshoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead\r\ncomrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds\r\ncylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa.\r\nThis done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good\r\nstretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well\r\nspread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some\r\nthree feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for\r\narm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The\r\nmincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.\r\nImmemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect\r\nhim, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.\r\n\n\r\nThat office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots; an\r\noperation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise against\r\nthe bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the minced pieces\r\ndrop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator\u2019s desk. Arrayed in decent\r\nblack; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate\r\nfor an archbishoprick, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer![21]\n\n\n [21]\r\nBible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates to the\r\nmincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin slices as\r\npossible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much\r\naccelerated, and its quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving\r\nit in quality.CHAPTER XCVI.THE TRY-WORKS\n\r\nBesides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her\r\ntry-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining\r\nwith oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. It is as if from the open\r\nfield a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.\r\n\n\r\nThe try-works are planted between the foremast and main-mast, the most roomy\r\npart of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength, fitted to\r\nsustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet\r\nby eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not penetrate the\r\ndeck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of\r\niron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the\r\nflanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large,\r\nsloping, battened hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots,\r\ntwo in number, and each of several barrels\u2019 capacity. When not in use,\r\nthey are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and\r\nsand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the night-watches\r\nsome cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there\r\nfor a nap. While employed in polishing them\u2014one man in each pot, side by\r\nside\u2014many confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips.\r\nIt is a place also for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left\r\nhand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me,\r\nthat I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all\r\nbodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from\r\nany point in precisely the same time.\r\n\n\r\nRemoving the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry of\r\nthat side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces,\r\ndirectly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron.\r\nThe intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the\r\ndeck, by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed\r\nsurface of the works. By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept\r\nreplenished with water as fast as it evaporates. There are no external\r\nchimneys; they open direct from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\n\r\nIt was about nine o\u2019clock at night that the Pequod\u2019s try-works were\r\nfirst started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\r\nworks.\u201d This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his\r\nshavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in a\r\nwhaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time with\r\nwood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of quick ignition to the\r\nstaple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber,\r\nnow called scraps or fritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous\r\nproperties. These fritters feed the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or\r\na self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and\r\nburns by his own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is\r\nhorrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must\r\nlive in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it,\r\nsuch as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left\r\nwing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.\r\n\n\r\nBy midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the carcase;\r\nsail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean darkness was\r\nintense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at\r\nintervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and illuminated every lofty rope\r\nin the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire. The burning ship drove on, as if\r\nremorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed. So the pitch and\r\nsulphur-freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their\r\nmidnight harbors, with broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the\r\nTurkish frigates, and folded them in conflagrations.\r\n\n\r\nThe hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth in\r\nfront of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan\r\nharpooneers, always the whale-ship\u2019s stokers. With huge pronged poles\r\nthey pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up\r\nthe fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors to\r\ncatch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every pitch\r\nof the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to\r\nleap into their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of\r\nthe wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here\r\nlounged the watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of\r\nthe fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny features,\r\nnow all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting\r\nbarbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the\r\ncapricious emblazonings of the works. As they narrated to each other their\r\nunholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth; as their\r\nuncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the\r\nfurnace; as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated\r\nwith their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea\r\nleaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell\r\nfurther and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\r\nchamped the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides;\r\nthen the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and\r\nburning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the\r\nmaterial counterpart of her monomaniac commander\u2019s soul.\r\n\n\r\nSo seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently guided\r\nthe way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval, in darkness\r\nmyself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the ghastliness of\r\nothers. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me, capering half in\r\nsmoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon\r\nas I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over\r\nme at a midnight helm.\r\n\n\r\nBut that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable) thing\r\noccurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious\r\nof something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned\r\nagainst it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the\r\nwind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers\r\nto the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of\r\nall this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a\r\nminute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp\r\nilluminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made\r\nghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever\r\nswift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as\r\nrushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came\r\nover me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit\r\nthat the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is\r\nthe matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about,\r\nand was fronting the ship\u2019s stern, with my back to her prow and the\r\ncompass. In an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from\r\nflying up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how\r\ngrateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the\r\nfatal contingency of being brought by the lee!\r\n\n\r\nLook not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy hand on\r\nthe helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint of the\r\nhitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all\r\nthings look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright;\r\nthose who glared like devils in the forking flames, the morn will show in far\r\nother, at least gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true\r\nlamp\u2014all others but liars!\r\n\n\r\nNevertheless the sun hides not Virginia\u2019s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome\u2019s\r\naccursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of deserts\r\nand of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark\r\nside of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore, that\r\nmortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be\r\ntrue\u2014not true, or undeveloped. With books the same. The truest of all men\r\nwas the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon\u2019s, and\r\nEcclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe. \u201cAll is vanity.\u201d\r\nALL. This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian\r\nSolomon\u2019s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks\r\nfast crossing grave-yards, and would rather talk of operas than hell; calls\r\nCowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and throughout a\r\ncare-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, and therefore\r\njolly;\u2014not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones, and break the\r\ngreen damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.\r\n\n\r\nBut even Solomon, he says, \u201cthe man that wandereth out of the way of\r\nunderstanding shall remain\u201d (i. e. even while living) \u201cin\r\nthe congregation of the dead.\u201d Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest\r\nit invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom that\r\nis woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in\r\nsome souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of\r\nthem again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever\r\nflies within the gorge, that gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his\r\nlowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the\r\nplain, even though they soar.CHAPTER XCVII.THE LAMP\n\r\nHad you descended from the Pequod\u2019s try-works to the Pequod\u2019s\r\nforecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you\r\nwould have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of\r\ncanonized kings and counsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken\r\nvaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his\r\nhooded eyes.\r\n\n\r\nIn merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens. To\r\ndress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in darkness to his pallet,\r\nthis is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of light, so he\r\nlives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin\u2019s lamp, and lays him down\r\nin it; so that in the pitchiest night the ship\u2019s black hull still houses\r\nan illumination.\r\n\n\r\nSee with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of\r\nlamps\u2014often but old bottles and vials, though\u2014to the copper cooler\r\nat the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He\r\nburns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,\r\nunvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral contrivances\r\nashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He goes and hunts for his\r\noil, so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller\r\non the prairie hunts up his own supper of game.CHAPTER XCVIII.STOWING DOWN AND CLEARING UP\n\r\nAlready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from\r\nthe mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and slaughtered in the\r\nvalleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded; and how (on\r\nthe principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the\r\nbeheaded was killed) his great padded surtout becomes the property of his\r\nexecutioner; how, in due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach,\r\nMeshach, and Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the\r\nfire;\u2014but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the\r\ndescription by rehearsing\u2014singing, if I may\u2014the romantic proceeding\r\nof decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold,\r\nwhere once again leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along\r\nbeneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.\r\n\n\r\nWhile still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the six-barrel\r\ncasks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that\r\nin the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over, end\r\nfor end, and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck, like so many\r\nland slides, till at last man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round\r\nthe hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, ex\r\nofficio, every sailor is a cooper.\r\n\n\r\nAt length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great\r\nhatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down go the\r\ncasks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are replaced, and\r\nhermetically closed, like a closet walled up.\r\n\n\r\nIn the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in\r\nall the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with freshets of blood\r\nand oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale\u2019s head\r\nare profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery yard; the\r\nsmoke from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about\r\nsuffused with unctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself;\r\nwhile on all hands the din is deafening.\r\n\n\r\nBut a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\r\nself-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works, you\r\nwould all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most\r\nscrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a\r\nsingularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never look so\r\nwhite as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the ashes of\r\nthe burned scraps of the whale, a potent ley is readily made; and whenever any\r\nadhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side, that ley\r\nquickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with\r\nbuckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot is\r\nbrushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which have been in\r\nuse are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed\r\nand placed upon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of\r\nsight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and\r\nsimultaneous industry of almost the entire ship\u2019s company, the whole of\r\nthis conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed\r\nto their own ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to\r\nthe immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from out\r\nthe daintiest Holland.\r\n\n\r\nNow, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and humorously\r\ndiscourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics; propose to mat the\r\ndeck; think of having hangings to the top; object not to taking tea by\r\nmoonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such musked mariners of\r\noil, and bone, and blubber, were little short of audacity. They know not the\r\nthing you distantly allude to. Away, and bring us napkins!\r\n\n\r\nBut mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent on\r\nspying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil the old\r\noaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere. Yes; and\r\nmany is the time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors, which know no\r\nnight; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat,\r\nwhere they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the\r\nLine,\u2014they only step to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the\r\nheavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be\r\nsmoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the\r\nequatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they have finally\r\nbestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it;\r\nmany is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean\r\nfrocks, are startled by the cry of \u201cThere she blows!\u201d and away they\r\nfly to fight another whale, and go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my\r\nfriends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals\r\nby long toilings extracted from the world\u2019s vast bulk its small but\r\nvaluable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its\r\ndefilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul; hardly\r\nis this done, when\u2014There she blows!\u2014the ghost is spouted up,\r\nand away we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life\u2019s\r\nold routine again.\r\n\n\r\nOh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two thousand\r\nyears ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with thee along the\r\nPeruvian coast last voyage\u2014and, foolish as I am, taught thee, a green\r\nsimple boy, how to splice a rope!CHAPTER XCIX.THE DOUBLOON\n\r\nEre now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck, taking\r\nregular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in the\r\nmultiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that\r\nsometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause\r\nin turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object\r\nbefore him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the\r\npointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed\r\nintensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the\r\nmainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin\r\nthere, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a\r\ncertain wild longing, if not hopefulness.\r\n\n\r\nBut one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted\r\nby the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the\r\nfirst time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever\r\nsignificance might lurk in them. And some certain significance lurks in all\r\nthings, else all things are little worth, and the round world itself but an\r\nempty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to\r\nfill up some morass in the Milky Way.\r\n\n\r\nNow this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart\r\nof gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the head-waters of\r\nmany a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron\r\nbolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to\r\nany foulness, it still preserved its Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a\r\nruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong\r\nnights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach,\r\nnevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last.\r\nFor it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton\r\nin their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white\r\nwhale\u2019s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by\r\nnight, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to\r\nspend it.\r\n\n\r\nNow those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and\r\ntropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun\u2019s disks and\r\nstars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in luxuriant\r\nprofusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added\r\npreciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through those fancy mints, so\r\nSpanishly poetic.\r\n\n\r\nIt so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of\r\nthese things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR:\r\nQUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the\r\nworld, and beneath the great equator, and named after it; and it had been cast\r\nmidway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those\r\nletters you saw the likeness of three Andes\u2019 summits; from one a flame; a\r\ntower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a\r\nsegment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual\r\ncabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra.\r\n\n\r\nBefore this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers,\r\nand all other grand and lofty things; look here,\u2014three peaks as proud as\r\nLucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the\r\ncourageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are\r\nAhab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a\r\nmagician\u2019s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own\r\nmysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask the world to solve\r\nthem; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face;\r\nbut see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months\r\nbefore he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be\r\nit, then. Born in throes, \u2019tis fit that man should live in pains and die\r\nin pangs! So be it, then! Here\u2019s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be\r\nit, then.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil\u2019s claws must\r\nhave left their mouldings there since yesterday,\u201d murmured Starbuck to\r\nhimself, leaning against the bulwarks. \u201cThe old man seems to read\r\nBelshazzar\u2019s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He\r\ngoes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding\r\npeaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this\r\nvale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of\r\nRighteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes, the\r\ndark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our\r\nglance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at\r\nmidnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in\r\nvain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will\r\nquit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere now\u2019s the old Mogul,\u201d soliloquized Stubb by the\r\ntry-works, \u201che\u2019s been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the\r\nsame, and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine\r\nfathoms long. And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now\r\non Negro Hill or in Corlaer\u2019s Hook, I\u2019d not look at it very long\r\nere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as\r\nqueer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old\r\nSpain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of\r\nBolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles,\r\nand joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this\r\ndoubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me read\r\nit once. Halloa! here\u2019s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old\r\nBowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanack below calls\r\nditto. I\u2019ll get the almanack and as I have heard devils can be raised\r\nwith Daboll\u2019s arithmetic, I\u2019ll try my hand at raising a meaning out\r\nof these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here\u2019s the\r\nbook. Let\u2019s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he\u2019s always\r\namong \u2019em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are\u2014here they go\u2014all\r\nalive:\u2014Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here\u2019s\r\nGemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among \u2019em. Aye,\r\nhere on the coin he\u2019s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve\r\nsitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must\r\nknow your places. You\u2019ll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we\r\ncome in to supply the thoughts. That\u2019s my small experience, so far as the\r\nMassachusetts calendar, and Bowditch\u2019s navigator, and Daboll\u2019s\r\narithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in\r\nsigns, and significant in wonders! There\u2019s a clue somewhere; wait a bit;\r\nhist\u2014hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is\r\nthe life of man in one round chapter; and now I\u2019ll read it off, straight\r\nout of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin: there\u2019s Aries, or the\r\nRam\u2014lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull\u2014he bumps\r\nus the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins\u2014that is, Virtue and Vice;\r\nwe try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and\r\nhere, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path\u2014he gives a\r\nfew fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the\r\nVirgin! that\u2019s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye,\r\nwhen pop comes Libra, or the Scales\u2014happiness weighed and found wanting;\r\nand while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio,\r\nor the Scorpion, stings us in rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come\r\nthe arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we\r\npluck out the shafts, stand aside; here\u2019s the battering-ram, Capricornus,\r\nor the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when\r\nAquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to\r\nwind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep. There\u2019s a sermon now, writ\r\nin high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it\r\nall alive and hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble;\r\nand so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly\u2019s the word for aye! Adieu,\r\nDoubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works,\r\nnow, and let\u2019s hear what he\u2019ll have to say. There; he\u2019s\r\nbefore it; he\u2019ll out with something presently. So, so; he\u2019s\r\nbeginning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a\r\ncertain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what\u2019s all this\r\nstaring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that\u2019s true; and at two\r\ncents the cigar, that\u2019s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won\u2019t\r\nsmoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here\u2019s nine hundred\r\nand sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy \u2019em out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cShall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a\r\nfoolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish\r\nlook to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman\u2014the old hearse-driver,\r\nhe must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He luffs up before the\r\ndoubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side of the mast; why,\r\nthere\u2019s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he\u2019s back again;\r\nwhat does that mean? Hark! he\u2019s muttering\u2014voice like an old\r\nworn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the\r\nsun stands in some one of these signs. I\u2019ve studied signs, and know their\r\nmarks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in Copenhagen.\r\nNow, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign; for there it is,\r\nright opposite the gold. And what\u2019s the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the\r\nhorse-shoe sign\u2014the roaring and devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old\r\nhead shakes to think of thee.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of\r\nmen in one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg\u2014all\r\ntattooing\u2014looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the\r\nCannibal? As I live he\u2019s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;\r\nthinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I suppose, as\r\nthe old women talk Surgeon\u2019s Astronomy in the back country. And by Jove,\r\nhe\u2019s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh\u2014I guess\r\nit\u2019s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don\u2019t know what to make of\r\nthe doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king\u2019s trowsers.\r\nBut, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of\r\nsight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he say, with\r\nthat look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is\r\na sun on the coin\u2014fire worshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more and more.\r\nThis way comes Pip\u2014poor boy! would he had died, or I; he\u2019s half\r\nhorrible to me. He too has been watching all of these interpreters\u2014myself\r\nincluded\u2014and look now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot face.\r\nStand away again and hear him. Hark!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUpon my soul, he\u2019s been studying Murray\u2019s Grammar! Improving\r\nhis mind, poor fellow! But what\u2019s that he says now\u2014hist!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, he\u2019s getting it by heart\u2014hist! again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s funny.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I\u2019m a\r\ncrow, especially when I stand a\u2019top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw!\r\ncaw! caw! caw! caw! Ain\u2019t I a crow? And where\u2019s the scare-crow?\r\nThere he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more\r\npoked into the sleeves of an old jacket.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWonder if he means me?\u2014complimentary!\u2014poor lad!\u2014I\r\ncould go hang myself. Any way, for the present, I\u2019ll quit Pip\u2019s\r\nvicinity. I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he\u2019s too\r\ncrazy-witty for my sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the ship\u2019s navel, this doubloon here, and they are\r\nall on fire to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what\u2019s the\r\nconsequence? Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when\r\naught\u2019s nailed to the mast it\u2019s a sign that things grow desperate.\r\nHa, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he\u2019ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My\r\nfather, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver\r\nring grown over in it; some old darkey\u2019s wedding ring. How did it get\r\nthere? And so they\u2019ll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up\r\nthis old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the\r\nshaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious gold!\u2014the green miser\r\n\u2019ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes \u2019mong the worlds\r\nblackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,\r\nJenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!\u201dCHAPTER C.LEG AND ARM.THE PEQUOD, OF\r\nNANTUCKET, MEETS THE SAMUEL ENDERBY, OF LONDON\n\r\n\u201cShip, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSo cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colors, bearing down\r\nunder the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his hoisted\r\nquarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain, who was\r\ncarelessly reclining in his own boat\u2019s bow. He was a darkly-tanned,\r\nburly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a\r\nspacious roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and\r\none empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a\r\nhuzzar\u2019s surcoat.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSee you this?\u201d and withdrawing it from the fold that had hidden\r\nit, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head\r\nlike a mallet.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMan my boat!\u201d cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars\r\nnear him\u2014\u201cStand by to lower!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were\r\ndropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But here a\r\ncurious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had\r\nforgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of\r\nany vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very\r\nhandy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be\r\nrigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment\u2019s warning. Now, it is\r\nno very easy matter for anybody\u2014except those who are almost hourly used\r\nto it, like whalemen\u2014to clamber up a ship\u2019s side from a boat on the\r\nopen sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,\r\nand then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of\r\none leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the\r\nkindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman\r\nagain; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to\r\nattain.\r\n\n\r\nIt has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance\r\nthat befel him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap, almost\r\ninvariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in the present instance, all this\r\nwas heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning\r\nover the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging\r\ntowards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did\r\nnot seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\r\nuse their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because\r\nthe strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out,\r\n\u201cI see, I see!\u2014avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the\r\ncutting-tackle.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\r\nprevious, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved\r\nblubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was\r\nquickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary\r\nthigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an\r\nanchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held himself\r\nfast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling\r\nhand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he was\r\ncarefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan\r\nhead. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain\r\nadvanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like\r\ntwo sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \u201cAye, aye, hearty!\r\nlet us shake bones together!\u2014an arm and a leg!\u2014an arm that never\r\ncan shrink, d\u2019ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did\u2019st\r\nthou see the White Whale?\u2014how long ago?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe White Whale,\u201d said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm\r\ntowards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a\r\ntelescope; \u201cThere I saw him, on the Line, last season.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd he took that arm off, did he?\u201d asked Ahab, now sliding down\r\nfrom the capstan, and resting on the Englishman\u2019s shoulder, as he did so.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSpin me the yarn,\u201d said Ahab; \u201chow was it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\u201d\r\nbegan the Englishman. \u201cI was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.\r\nWell, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened\r\nto one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and\r\nmilling round so, that my boat\u2019s crew could only trim dish, by sitting\r\nall their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom of\r\nthe sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all\r\ncrows\u2019 feet and wrinkles.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was he, it was he!\u201d cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his\r\nsuspended breath.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye\u2014they were mine\u2014my irons,\u201d cried Ahab,\r\nexultingly\u2014\u201cbut on!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive me a chance, then,\u201d said the Englishman, good-humoredly.\r\n\u201cWell, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all\r\nafoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, I see!\u2014wanted to part it; free the fast-fish\u2014an old\r\ntrick\u2014I know him.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow it was exactly,\u201d continued the one-armed commander, \u201cI\r\ndo not know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\r\nsomehow; but we didn\u2019t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on\r\nthe line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other\r\nwhale\u2019s that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood,\r\nand what a noble great whale it was\u2014the noblest and biggest I ever saw,\r\nsir, in my life\u2014I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he\r\nseemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth\r\nit was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat\u2019s crew for a\r\npull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first\r\nmate\u2019s boat\u2014Mr. Mounttop\u2019s here (by the way,\r\nCaptain\u2014Mounttop; Mounttop\u2014the captain);\u2014as I was saying, I\r\njumped into Mounttop\u2019s boat, which, d\u2019ye see, was gunwale and\r\ngunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\r\ngreat-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir\u2014hearts and souls\r\nalive, man\u2014the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat\u2014both\r\neyes out\u2014all befogged and bedeadened with black foam\u2014the\r\nwhale\u2019s tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air,\r\nlike a marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at\r\nmidday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after\r\nthe second iron, to toss it overboard\u2014down comes the tail like a Lima\r\ntower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes\r\nfirst, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We\r\nall struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my\r\nharpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking\r\nfish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish,\r\ntaking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that\r\ncursed second iron towing along near me caught me here\u201d (clapping his\r\nhand just below his shoulder); \u201cyes, caught me just here, I say, and bore\r\nme down to Hell\u2019s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden,\r\nthank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh\u2014clear along the\r\nwhole length of my arm\u2014came out nigh my wrist, and up I\r\nfloated;\u2014and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way,\r\ncaptain\u2014Dr. Bunger, ship\u2019s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,\u2014the\r\ncaptain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the time\r\nstanding near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly\r\nrank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed\r\nin a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far\r\nbeen dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a\r\npill-box held in the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory\r\nlimbs of the two crippled captains. But, at his superior\u2019s introduction\r\nof him to Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his\r\ncaptain\u2019s bidding.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt was a shocking bad wound,\u201d began the whale-surgeon; \u201cand,\r\ntaking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSamuel Enderby is the name of my ship,\u201d interrupted the one-armed\r\ncaptain, addressing Ahab; \u201cgo on, boy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot\r\nweather there on the Line. But it was no use\u2014I did all I could; sat up\r\nwith him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, very severe!\u201d chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly\r\naltering his voice, \u201cDrinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till\r\nhe couldn\u2019t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas\r\nover, about three o\u2019clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me\r\nindeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very\r\ndietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why\r\ndon\u2019t ye? You know you\u2019re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave\r\nahead, boy, I\u2019d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other\r\nman.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected\r\nsir\u201d\u2014said the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing\r\nto Ahab\u2014\u201cis apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever\r\nthings of that sort. But I may as well say\u2014en passant, as the French\r\nremark\u2014that I myself\u2014that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the\r\nreverend clergy\u2014am a strict total abstinence man; I never\r\ndrink\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWater!\u201d cried the captain; \u201che never drinks it; it\u2019s a\r\nsort of fits to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go\r\non\u2014go on with the arm story.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, I may as well,\u201d said the surgeon, coolly. \u201cI was about\r\nobserving, sir, before Captain Boomer\u2019s facetious interruption, that\r\nspite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and\r\nworse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;\r\nmore than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead line.\r\nIn short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came. But I had\r\nno hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is against all\r\nrule\u201d\u2014pointing at it with the marlingspike\u2014\u201cthat is the\r\ncaptain\u2019s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had\r\nthat club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one\u2019s brains out\r\nwith, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical passions\r\nsometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir\u201d\u2014removing his hat, and brushing\r\naside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore\r\nnot the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a\r\nwound\u2014\u201cWell, the captain there will tell you how that came here; he\r\nknows.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said the captain, \u201cbut his mother did;\r\nhe was born with it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you\u2014you Bunger! was there ever\r\nsuch another Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die\r\nin pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat became of the White Whale?\u201d now cried Ahab, who thus far had\r\nbeen impatiently listening to this bye-play between the two Englishmen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d cried the one-armed captain, \u201cOh, yes! Well; after he\r\nsounded, we didn\u2019t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before\r\nhinted, I didn\u2019t then know what whale it was that had served me such a\r\ntrick, till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about\r\nMoby Dick\u2014as some call him\u2014and then I knew it was he.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDid\u2019st thou cross his wake again?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTwice.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut could not fasten?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t want to try to: ain\u2019t one limb enough? What should I\r\ndo without this other arm? And I\u2019m thinking Moby Dick doesn\u2019t bite\r\nso much as he swallows.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d interrupted Bunger, \u201cgive him your left arm for\r\nbait to get the right. Do you know, gentlemen\u201d\u2014very gravely and\r\nmathematically bowing to each Captain in succession\u2014\u201cDo you know,\r\ngentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably\r\nconstructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to\r\ncompletely digest even a man\u2019s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you\r\ntake for the White Whale\u2019s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never\r\nmeans to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But\r\nsometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in\r\nCeylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop\r\ninto him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I\r\ngave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d\u2019ye see. No\r\npossible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into\r\nhis general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about\r\nit, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving\r\ndecent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the\r\nwhale have another chance at you shortly, that\u2019s all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, thank ye, Bunger,\u201d said the English Captain, \u201che\u2019s\r\nwelcome to the arm he has, since I can\u2019t help it, and didn\u2019t know\r\nhim then; but not to another one. No more White Whales for me; I\u2019ve\r\nlowered for him once, and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in\r\nkilling him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him,\r\nbut, hark ye, he\u2019s best let alone; don\u2019t you think so,\r\nCaptain?\u201d\u2014glancing at the ivory leg.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let\r\nalone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He\u2019s all a\r\nmagnet! How long since thou saw\u2019st him last? Which way heading?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBless my soul, and curse the foul fiend\u2019s,\u201d cried Bunger,\r\nstoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; \u201cthis\r\nman\u2019s blood\u2014bring the thermometer;\u2014it\u2019s at the boiling\r\npoint!\u2014his pulse makes these planks beat!\u2014sir!\u201d\u2014taking\r\na lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab\u2019s arm.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAvast!\u201d roared Ahab, dashing him against the\r\nbulwarks\u2014\u201cMan the boat! Which way heading?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d cried the English Captain, to whom the question was\r\nput. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? He was heading east, I think.\u2014Is\r\nyour Captain crazy?\u201d whispering Fedallah.\r\n\n\r\nBut Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take the\r\nboat\u2019s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards him,\r\ncommanded the ship\u2019s sailors to stand by to lower.\r\n\n\r\nIn a moment he was standing in the boat\u2019s stern, and the Manilla men were\r\nspringing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back to\r\nthe stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright\r\ntill alongside of the Pequod.CHAPTER CI.THE DECANTER\n\r\nEre the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she hailed\r\nfrom London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant of that\r\ncity, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby & Sons; a house\r\nwhich in my poor whaleman\u2019s opinion, comes not far behind the united\r\nroyal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real historical interest.\r\nHow long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in\r\nexistence, my numerous fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year\r\n(1775) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the\r\nSperm Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our\r\nvaliant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets\r\npursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not\r\nelsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first\r\namong mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that\r\nfor half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so\r\nharpooned him.\r\n\n\r\nIn 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at\r\nthe sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the\r\nfirst among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South\r\nSea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with\r\nher hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia\u2019s example was soon\r\nfollowed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale\r\ngrounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with this good deed,\r\nthe indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his\r\nSons\u2014how many, their mother only knows\u2014and under their immediate\r\nauspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British government was\r\ninduced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into\r\nthe South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling\r\nvoyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this is not\r\nall. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to\r\ngo on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That ship\u2014well\r\ncalled the \u201cSyren\u201d\u2014made a noble experimental cruise; and it\r\nwas thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.\r\nThe Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a\r\nNantucketer.\r\n\n\r\nAll honor to the Enderbys, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to the\r\npresent day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped\r\nhis cable for the great South Sea of the other world.\r\n\n\r\nThe ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast sailer and\r\na noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the\r\nPatagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the forecastle. It was a fine gam\r\nwe had, and they were all trumps\u2014every soul on board. A short life to\r\nthem, and a jolly death. And that fine gam I had\u2014long, very long after\r\nold Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel\u2014it minds me of the noble,\r\nsolid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the\r\ndevil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip?\r\nYes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall\r\ncame (for it\u2019s squally off there by Patagonia), and all\r\nhands\u2014visitors and all\u2014were called to reef topsails, we were so\r\ntop-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly\r\nfurled the skirts of our jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed\r\nfast in the howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the\r\nmasts did not go overboard; and by and bye we scrambled down, so sober, that we\r\nhad to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the\r\nforecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste.\r\n\n\r\nThe beef was fine\u2014tough, but with body in it. They said it was bull-beef;\r\nothers, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for certain, how that\r\nwas. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular,\r\nand indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you could feel them, and roll them\r\nabout in you after they were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward,\r\nyou risked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread\u2014but\r\nthat couldn\u2019t be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the\r\nbread contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very\r\nlight, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it.\r\nBut all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of\r\nthe cook\u2019s boilers, including his own live parchment boilers; fore and\r\naft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine\r\nflip and strong; crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.\r\n\n\r\nBut why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English\r\nwhalers I know of\u2014not all though\u2014were such famous, hospitable\r\nships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the joke;\r\nand were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I will tell you.\r\nThe abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical\r\nresearch. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research, when it\r\nhas seemed needed.\r\n\n\r\nThe English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders, Zealanders,\r\nand Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery; and\r\nwhat is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty to eat and drink.\r\nFor, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so\r\nthe English whaler. Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is\r\nnot normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must\r\nhave some special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further\r\nelucidated.\r\n\n\r\nDuring my researches in the leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an ancient\r\nDutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must be about\r\nwhalers. The title was, \u201cDan Coopman,\u201d wherefore I concluded that\r\nthis must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as\r\nevery whale ship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in this opinion by\r\nseeing that it was the production of one \u201cFitz Swackhammer.\u201d But my\r\nfriend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German\r\nin the college of Santa Claus and St. Pott\u2019s, to whom I handed the work\r\nfor translation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble\u2014this\r\nsame Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured me that \u201cDan\r\nCoopman\u201d did not mean \u201cThe Cooper,\u201d but \u201cThe\r\nMerchant.\u201d In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of\r\nthe commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very\r\ninteresting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it was, headed\r\n\u201cSmeer,\u201d or \u201cFat,\u201d that I found a long detailed list of\r\nthe outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from\r\nwhich list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead. I transcribe the following:\r\n\n\r\n400,000 lbs. of beef.\r\n60,000 lbs. Friesland pork.\r\n150,000 lbs. of stock fish.\r\n550,000 lbs. of biscuit.\r\n72,000 lbs. of soft bread.\r\n2,800 firkins of butter.\r\n20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese.\r\n144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article).\r\n550 ankers of Geneva.\r\n10,800 barrels of beer.\r\n\n\r\nMost statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the\r\npresent case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes, barrels,\r\nquarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.\r\n\n\r\nAt the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer,\r\nbeef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were incidentally\r\nsuggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic application; and,\r\nfurthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my own, touching the probable\r\nquantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that\r\nancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery. In the first place, the amount\r\nof butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it,\r\nthough, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous\r\nby the nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in\r\nthose frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the\r\nconvivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\r\n\n\r\nThe quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those polar\r\nfisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate, so that\r\nthe whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen, including the short voyage to\r\nand from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much exceed three months, say, and\r\nreckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch\r\nseamen in all; therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man,\r\nfor a twelve weeks\u2019 allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that\r\n550 ankers of gin. Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as\r\none might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a\r\nboat\u2019s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat\r\nimprobable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far\r\nNorth, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the\r\nEquator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer\r\nsleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to\r\nNantucket and New Bedford.\r\n\n\r\nBut no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or\r\nthree centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers have not\r\nneglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when cruising in an empty\r\nship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a good dinner out of\r\nit, at least. And this empties the decanter.CHAPTER CII.A BOWER IN THE ARSACIDES\n\r\nHitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt\r\nupon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few\r\ninterior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping\r\ncomprehension of him, it behoves me now to unbutton him still further, and\r\nuntagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the\r\nhooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in\r\nhis ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.\r\n\n\r\nBut how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery,\r\npretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite\r\nStubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the\r\nCetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition?\r\nExplain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for\r\nexamination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have\r\nyou hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of\r\nJonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the\r\nrafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of\r\nleviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and\r\ncheeseries in his bowels.\r\n\n\r\nI confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the\r\nskin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed with an opportunity\r\nto dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale\r\nwas once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths for\r\nthe barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the lances. Think you I let\r\nthat chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the\r\nseal and reading all the contents of that young cub?\r\n\n\r\nAnd as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic,\r\nfull grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal\r\nfriend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For being at Tranque,\r\nyears ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to\r\nspend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired\r\npalm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our\r\nsailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.\r\n\n\r\nAmong many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted with a\r\ndevout love for all matters of barbaric vert\u00f9, had brought together in Pupella\r\nwhatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent; chiefly\r\ncarved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly\r\npaddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural\r\nwonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his\r\nshores.\r\n\n\r\nChief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an unusually\r\nlong raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his head against a\r\ncocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet.\r\nWhen the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings, and\r\nthe bones become dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully\r\ntransported up the Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now\r\nsheltered it.\r\n\n\r\nThe ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebr\u00e6 were carved with Arsacidean\r\nannals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests kept up an\r\nunextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again sent forth its\r\nvapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated\r\nover all the devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen; the\r\ntrees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the industrious earth\r\nbeneath was as a weaver\u2019s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the\r\nground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living flowers the\r\nfigures. All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the shrubs, and\r\nferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were\r\nactive. Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying\r\nshuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen\r\nweaver!\u2014pause!\u2014one word!\u2014whither flows the fabric? what\r\npalace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak,\r\nweaver!\u2014stay thy hand!\u2014but one single word with thee! Nay\u2014the\r\nshuttle flies\u2014the figures float from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing\r\ncarpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is\r\nhe deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who\r\nlook on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear the\r\nthousand voices that speak through it. For even so it is in all material\r\nfactories. The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those\r\nsame words are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened\r\ncasements. Thereby have villanies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful;\r\nfor so, in all this din of the great world\u2019s loom, thy subtlest thinkings\r\nmay be overheard afar.\r\n\n\r\nNow, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the great,\r\nwhite, worshipped skeleton lay lounging\u2014a gigantic idler! Yet, as the\r\never-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him, the mighty\r\nidler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over with the vines; every\r\nmonth assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself a skeleton. Life folded\r\nDeath; Death trellised Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat\r\nhim curly-headed glories.\r\n\n\r\nNow, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the skull\r\nan altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had\r\nissued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vert\u00f9.\r\nHe laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet\r\nof his was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton\u2014brushed the\r\nvines aside\u2014broke through the ribs\u2014and with a ball of Arsacidean\r\ntwine, wandered, eddied long amid its many winding, shaded collonades and\r\narbors. But soon my line was out; and following it back, I emerged from the\r\nopening where I entered. I saw no living thing within; naught was there but\r\nbones.\r\n\n\r\nCutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton. From\r\ntheir arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the altitude of\r\nthe final rib. \u201cHow now!\u201d they shouted; \u201cDar\u2019st thou\r\nmeasure this our god! That\u2019s for us.\u201d \u201cAye,\r\npriests\u2014well, how long do ye make him, then?\u201d But hereupon a fierce\r\ncontest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they cracked each\r\nother\u2019s sconces with their yard-sticks\u2014the great skull\r\nechoed\u2014and seizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own\r\nadmeasurements.\r\n\n\r\nThese admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it\r\nrecorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied measurement\r\nI please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to, to test my\r\naccuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell me, in Hull, England, one of\r\nthe whaling ports of that country, where they have some fine specimens of\r\nfin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of\r\nManchester, in New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call \u201cthe\r\nonly perfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United\r\nStates.\u201d Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by\r\nname, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a\r\nSperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of\r\nmy friend King Tranquo\u2019s.\r\n\n\r\nIn both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged, were\r\noriginally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King Tranquo\r\nseizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was lord of the\r\nseignories of those parts. Sir Clifford\u2019s whale has been articulated\r\nthroughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him,\r\nin all his bony cavities\u2014spread out his ribs like a gigantic\r\nfan\u2014and swing all day upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some\r\nof his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors\r\nwith a bunch of keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for\r\na peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the\r\necho in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from\r\nhis forehead.\r\n\n\r\nThe skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim\r\nfrom my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild wanderings at that\r\nperiod, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics.\r\nBut as I was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain\r\na blank page for a poem I was then composing\u2014at least, what untattooed\r\nparts might remain\u2014I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor,\r\nindeed, should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.CHAPTER CIII.MEASUREMENT OF THE WHALE\u2019S SKELETON\n\r\nIn the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain statement,\r\ntouching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we are briefly to\r\nexhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\r\n\n\r\nAccording to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base upon\r\nCaptain Scoresby\u2019s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized\r\nGreenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful calculation, I\r\nsay, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety\r\nfeet in length, and something less than forty feet in its fullest\r\ncircumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that reckoning\r\nthirteen men to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population\r\nof a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants.\r\n\n\r\nThink you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this\r\nleviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman\u2019s imagination?\r\n\n\r\nHaving already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw,\r\nteeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply point\r\nout what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones. But\r\nas the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent\r\nof the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated part; and as nothing is\r\nto be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in\r\nyour mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a\r\ncomplete notion of the general structure we are about to view.\r\n\n\r\nIn length, the Sperm Whale\u2019s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\r\nfeet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been\r\nninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in\r\nlength compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet, his skull and\r\njaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain back-bone.\r\nAttached to this back-bone, for something less than a third of its length, was\r\nthe mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals. To me this\r\nvast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine, extending far away\r\nfrom it in a straight line, not a little resembled the hull of a great ship\r\nnew-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are\r\ninserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the time, but a long, disconnected\r\ntimber.\r\n\n\r\nThe ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly six\r\nfeet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively longer, till\r\nyou came to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle ribs, which measured\r\neight feet and some inches. From that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till\r\nthe tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches. In general\r\nthickness, they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle\r\nribs were the most arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams\r\nwhereon to lay foot-path bridges over small streams.\r\n\n\r\nIn considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\r\ncircumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the\r\nwhale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of the Tranque\r\nribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish which, in life, is\r\ngreatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the invested body of this\r\nparticular whale must have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the\r\ncorresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet. So that this rib\r\nonly conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part.\r\nBesides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all that had been\r\nonce wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels.\r\nStill more, for the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in\r\nplace of the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\r\n\n\r\nHow vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try to\r\ncomprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead\r\nattenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the heart of\r\nquickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes; only on the\r\nprofound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly\r\nfound out.\r\n\n\r\nBut the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a crane, to\r\npile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it\u2019s done,\r\nit looks much like Pompey\u2019s Pillar.\r\n\n\r\nThere are forty and odd vertebr\u00e6 in all, which in the skeleton are not locked\r\ntogether. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire,\r\nforming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a middle one, is in width\r\nsomething less than three feet, and in depth more than four. The smallest,\r\nwhere the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and\r\nlooks something like a white billiard-ball. I was told that there were still\r\nsmaller ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the\r\npriest\u2019s children, who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see\r\nhow that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into\r\nsimple child\u2019s play.CHAPTER CIV.THE FOSSIL WHALE\n\r\nFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to\r\nenlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not compress\r\nhim. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio. Not to tell\r\nover again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about\r\nthe waist; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they\r\nlie in him like great cables and hausers coiled away in the subterranean\r\norlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.\r\n\n\r\nSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behoves me to approve\r\nmyself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking the minutest\r\nseminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his\r\nbowels. Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and\r\nanatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an arch\u00e6ological,\r\nfossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature\r\nthan the Leviathan\u2014to an ant or a flea\u2014such portly terms might\r\njustly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text,\r\nthe case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest\r\nwords of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been\r\nconvenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have\r\ninvariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased for that\r\npurpose; because that famous lexicographer\u2019s uncommon personal bulk more\r\nfitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.\r\n\n\r\nOne often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it\r\nmay seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this Leviathan?\r\nUnconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals. Give me a\r\ncondor\u2019s quill! Give me Vesuvius\u2019 crater for an inkstand! Friends,\r\nhold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan,\r\nthey weary me, and make me faint with their out-reaching comprehensiveness of\r\nsweep, as if to include the whole circle of the sciences, and all the\r\ngenerations of whales, and men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with\r\nall the revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout the whole\r\nuniverse, not excluding its suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of\r\na large and liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you\r\nmust choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on\r\nthe flea, though many there be who have tried it.\r\n\n\r\nEre entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials as a\r\ngeologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone-mason,\r\nand also a great digger of ditches, canals, and wells, wine-vaults, cellars,\r\nand cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind\r\nthe reader, that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the\r\nfossils of monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics\r\ndiscovered in what are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or\r\nat any rate intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those\r\nwhose remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales\r\nhitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding\r\nthe superficial formations. And though none of them precisely answer to any\r\nknown species of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them in\r\ngeneral respects, to justify their taking ranks as Cetacean fossils.\r\n\n\r\nDetached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones and\r\nskeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been found at\r\nthe base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in\r\nthe States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious of\r\nsuch remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the\r\nRue Dauphin\u00e9 in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the palace\r\nof the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of\r\nAntwerp, in Napoleon\u2019s time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have\r\nbelonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species.\r\n\n\r\nBut by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete\r\nvast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on the plantation\r\nof Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity\r\ntook it for the bones of one of the fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared\r\nit a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some\r\nspecimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist,\r\nit turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed\r\nspecies. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in\r\nthis book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the\r\nshape of his fully invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon;\r\nand in his paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in\r\nsubstance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the\r\nglobe have blotted out of existence.\r\n\n\r\nWhen I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws, ribs,\r\nand vertebr\u00e6, all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds\r\nof sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar\r\naffinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable\r\nseniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time itself\r\ncan be said to have begun; for time began with man. Here Saturn\u2019s grey\r\nchaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar\r\neternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the\r\nTropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this world\u2019s circumference, not\r\nan inhabitable hand\u2019s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world\r\nwas the whale\u2019s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the\r\npresent lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like\r\nLeviathan? Ahab\u2019s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh\u2019s.\r\nMethuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I am\r\nhorror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the unspeakable\r\nterrors of the whale, which, having been before all time, must needs exist\r\nafter all humane ages are over.\r\n\n\r\nBut not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the stereotype\r\nplates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust; but\r\nupon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost\r\nfossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print of his fin. In an\r\napartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was\r\ndiscovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere,\r\nabounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures\r\non the celestial globe of the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam\r\nas of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon\r\nwas cradled.\r\n\n\r\nNor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the\r\nwhale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by the venerable\r\nJohn Leo, the old Barbary traveller.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of\r\nwhich are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes\r\ncast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that by a secret Power\r\nbestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it without immediate death.\r\nBut the truth of the Matter is, that on either side of the Temple, there are\r\nRocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light\r\nupon \u2019em. They keep a Whale\u2019s Rib of an incredible length for a\r\nMiracle, which lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an\r\nArch, the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel\u2019s Back.\r\nThis Rib (says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I\r\nsaw it. Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy\u2019d of\r\nMahomet, came from this Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the\r\nProphet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a\r\nNantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.CHAPTER CV.DOES THE WHALE\u2019S MAGNITUDE\r\nDIMINISH?\u2014WILL HE PERISH?\n\r\nInasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the\r\nhead-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the long\r\ncourse of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his\r\nsires.\r\n\n\r\nBut upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the present day\r\nsuperior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary\r\nsystem (embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but of the whales\r\nfound in that Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed\r\nin size those of its earlier ones.\r\n\n\r\nOf all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama\r\none mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy feet in\r\nlength in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure\r\ngives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I\r\nhave heard, on whalemen\u2019s authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured\r\nnear a hundred feet long at the time of capture.\r\n\n\r\nBut may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in\r\nmagnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not be, that\r\nsince Adam\u2019s time they have degenerated?\r\n\n\r\nAssuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such\r\ngentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us\r\nof whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which\r\nmeasured eight hundred feet in length\u2014Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of\r\nWhales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke\u2019s naturalists,\r\nwe find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland\r\nWhales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards;\r\nthat is, three hundred and sixty feet. And Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de, the French naturalist, in\r\nhis elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page 3),\r\nsets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight\r\nfeet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.\r\n\n\r\nBut will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as big\r\nas his ancestors in Pliny\u2019s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a\r\nwhaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot\r\nunderstand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried\r\nthousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their\r\ncoffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other\r\nanimals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative\r\nproportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred,\r\nstall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in\r\nmagnitude the fattest of Pharaoh\u2019s fat kine; in the face of all this, I\r\nwill not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.\r\n\n\r\nBut still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more recondite\r\nNantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the\r\nmast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even through Behring\u2019s\r\nstraits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the\r\nthousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts; the moot\r\npoint is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless\r\na havoc; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the\r\nlast whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate\r\nin the final puff.\r\n\n\r\nComparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo, which,\r\nnot forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois\r\nand Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted\r\nbrows upon the sites of populous river-capitals, where now the polite broker\r\nsells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible\r\nargument would seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape\r\nspeedy extinction.\r\n\n\r\nBut you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period\r\nago\u2014not a good life-time\u2014the census of the buffalo in Illinois\r\nexceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day not one\r\nhorn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the cause of this\r\nwondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far different nature of\r\nthe whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.\r\nForty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whale for forty-eight months think they\r\nhave done extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of\r\nforty fish. Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and\r\ntrappers of the West, when the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a\r\nwilderness and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number\r\nof months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not\r\nforty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could\r\nbe statistically stated.\r\n\n\r\nNor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favor of the gradual\r\nextinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the latter\r\npart of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods, were\r\nencountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were\r\nnot so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative. Because, as has been\r\nelsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim\r\nthe seas in immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered\r\nsolitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into\r\nvast but widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally\r\nfallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone whales no\r\nlonger haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that\r\nspecies also is declining. For they are only being driven from promontory to\r\ncape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure,\r\nsome other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar\r\nspectacle.\r\n\n\r\nFurthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two firm\r\nfortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain impregnable.\r\nAnd as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss have retreated to\r\ntheir mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas,\r\nthe whale-bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving\r\nunder the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields\r\nand floes; and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all\r\npursuit from man.\r\n\n\r\nBut as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot,\r\nsome philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has\r\nalready very seriously diminished their battalions. But though for some time\r\npast a number of these whales, not less than 13,000 have been annually slain on\r\nthe nor\u2019 west coast by the Americans alone; yet there are considerations\r\nwhich render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing\r\nargument in this matter.\r\n\n\r\nNatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the\r\nmore enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto, the\r\nhistorian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took\r\n4000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of\r\ncattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to doubt that if\r\nthese elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by\r\nSemiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the\r\nEast\u2014if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may the\r\ngreat whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate in, which\r\nis precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New\r\nHolland, and all the Isles of the sea combined.\r\n\n\r\nMoreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of whales,\r\ntheir probably attaining the age of a century and more, therefore at any one\r\nperiod of time, several distinct adult generations must be contemporary. And\r\nwhat that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards,\r\ncemeteries, and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all\r\nthe men, women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding\r\nthis countless host to the present human population of the globe.\r\n\n\r\nWherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his species,\r\nhowever perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas before the continents\r\nbroke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries, and Windsor Castle,\r\nand the Kremlin. In Noah\u2019s flood, he despised Noah\u2019s Ark; and if\r\never the world is to be again flooded, like the Netherlands, to kill off its\r\nrats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost\r\ncrest of the equatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.CHAPTER CVI.AHAB\u2019S LEG\n\r\nThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby\r\nof London, had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person.\r\nHe had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg\r\nhad received a half-splintering shock. And when after gaining his own deck, and\r\nhis own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command\r\nto the steersman (it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly\r\nenough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and\r\nwrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet\r\nAhab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.\r\n\n\r\nAnd, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his pervading, mad\r\nrecklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead\r\nbone upon which he partly stood. For it had not been very long prior to the\r\nPequod\u2019s sailing from Nantucket, that he had been found one night lying\r\nprone upon the ground, and insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly\r\ninexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb having been so violently\r\ndisplaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor\r\nwas it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.\r\n\n\r\nNor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the\r\nanguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former\r\nwoe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of\r\nthe marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the\r\ngrove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget\r\ntheir like. Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and\r\nposterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not\r\nto hint of this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that\r\nwhile some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the\r\nother world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness\r\nof all hell\u2019s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still\r\nfertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond\r\nthe grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the\r\ndeeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly\r\nfelicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at\r\nbottom, all heart-woes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an archangelic\r\ngrandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction. To\r\ntrail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among\r\nthe sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the\r\nglad, hay-making suns, and soft-cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs\r\ngive in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad. The\r\nineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in\r\nthe signers.\r\n\n\r\nUnwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more properly,\r\nin set way, have been disclosed before. With many other particulars concerning\r\nAhab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why it was, that for a certain\r\nperiod, both before and after the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself\r\naway with such Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval,\r\nsought speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.\r\nCaptain Peleg\u2019s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means\r\nadequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab\u2019s deeper part, every\r\nrevelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light. But,\r\nin the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least. That direful mishap\r\nwas at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that\r\never-contracting, dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the\r\nprivilege of a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above\r\nhinted casualty\u2014remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by\r\nAhab\u2014invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the land\r\nof spirits and of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all\r\nconspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from\r\nothers; and hence it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed,\r\ndid it transpire upon the Pequod\u2019s decks.\r\n\n\r\nBut be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or the\r\nvindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with earthly Ahab,\r\nyet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain practical\r\nprocedures;\u2014he called the carpenter.\r\n\n\r\nAnd when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay set\r\nabout making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the\r\nstuds and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus far been accumulated\r\non the voyage, in order that a careful selection of the stoutest,\r\nclearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the carpenter received\r\norders to have the leg completed that night; and to provide all the fittings\r\nfor it, independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover,\r\nthe ship\u2019s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness\r\nin the hold; and, to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to\r\nproceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.CHAPTER CVII.THE CARPENTER\n\r\nSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high abstracted\r\nman alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But from the same\r\npoint, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they seem a mob of\r\nunnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary. But most humble\r\nthough he was, and far from furnishing an example of the high, humane\r\nabstraction; the Pequod\u2019s carpenter was no duplicate; hence, he now comes\r\nin person on this stage.\r\n\n\r\nLike all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to\r\nwhaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent, alike\r\nexperienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the\r\ncarpenter\u2019s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those\r\nnumerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary\r\nmaterial. But, besides the application to him of the generic remark above, this\r\ncarpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless\r\nmechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or\r\nfour years\u2019 voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak\r\nof his readiness in ordinary duties:\u2014repairing stove boats, sprung spars,\r\nreforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull\u2019s eyes in the\r\ndeck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters\r\nmore directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover\r\nunhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and\r\ncapricious.\r\n\n\r\nThe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold, was his\r\nvice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices, of\r\ndifferent sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times except when whales\r\nwere alongside, this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of\r\nthe Try-works.\r\n\n\r\nA belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the\r\ncarpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway files it\r\nsmaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board, and is made a\r\ncaptive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm\r\nwhale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman\r\nsprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for\r\nvermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each\r\noar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\r\nconstellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the\r\ncarpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out\r\npincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the\r\npoor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round\r\nthe handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that,\r\nif he would have him draw the tooth.\r\n\n\r\nThus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and\r\nwithout respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed but\r\ntop-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so\r\nwide a field thus variously accomplished, and with such liveliness of\r\nexpertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of\r\nintelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable,\r\nthan for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it\r\nso shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with\r\nthe general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while\r\npauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and\r\nignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this\r\nhalf-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an\r\nall-ramifying heartlessness;\u2014yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an\r\nold, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and\r\nthen with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the\r\ntime during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah\u2019s ark.\r\nWas it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much\r\nrolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had\r\nrubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to\r\nhim? He was a stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a\r\nnew-born babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.\r\nYou might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a\r\nsort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so\r\nmuch by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to it, or\r\nby any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf\r\nand dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if\r\nhe had ever had one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his\r\nfingers. He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful,\r\nmultum in parvo, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the\r\nexterior\u2014though a little swelled\u2014of a common pocket knife; but\r\ncontaining, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers,\r\ncork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, counter-sinkers. So, if\r\nhis superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to\r\ndo was to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers,\r\ntake him up by the legs, and there they were.\r\n\n\r\nYet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was, after\r\nall, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a common soul in him,\r\nhe had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty. What that was,\r\nwhether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no\r\ntelling. But there it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or\r\nmore. And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him;\r\nthis it was, that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only\r\nlike an unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his\r\nbody was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the\r\ntime to keep himself awake.CHAPTER CVIII.AHAB AND THE CARPENTER\n\r\nTHE DECK\u2014FIRST NIGHT WATCH\r\n\n\r\n(Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two lanterns\r\nbusily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly fixed in the\r\nvice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws, and various tools of all\r\nsorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red flame of the forge is seen, where\r\nthe blacksmith is at work.)\r\n\n\r\nDrat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft, and that\r\nsoft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and shinbones.\r\nLet\u2019s try another. Aye, now, this works better (sneezes). Halloa,\r\nthis bone dust is (sneezes)\u2014why it\u2019s\r\n(sneezes)\u2014yes it\u2019s (sneezes)\u2014bless my soul, it\r\nwon\u2019t let me speak! This is what an old fellow gets now for working in\r\ndead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you don\u2019t get this dust; amputate a\r\nlive bone, and you don\u2019t get it (sneezes). Come, come, you old\r\nSmut, there, bear a hand, and let\u2019s have that ferule and buckle-screw;\r\nI\u2019ll be ready for them presently. Lucky now (sneezes)\r\nthere\u2019s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere\r\nshinbone\u2014why it\u2019s easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to\r\nput a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn him\r\nout as neat a leg now as ever (sneezes) scraped to a lady in a parlor.\r\nThose buckskin legs and calves of legs I\u2019ve seen in shop windows\r\nwouldn\u2019t compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get\r\nrheumatic, and have to be doctored (sneezes) with washes and lotions,\r\njust like live legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old\r\nMogulship, and see whether the length will be all right; too short, if\r\nanything, I guess. Ha! that\u2019s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or\r\nit\u2019s somebody else, that\u2019s certain.\r\n\n\r\nAHAB (advancing).\r\n(During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues sneezing at times).\r\n\n\r\nWell, manmaker!\r\n\n\r\nJust in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length. Let me\r\nmeasure, sir.\r\n\n\r\nMeasured for a leg! good. Well, it\u2019s not the first time. About it! There;\r\nkeep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter; let me\r\nfeel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.\r\n\n\r\nOh, sir, it will break bones\u2014beware, beware!\r\n\n\r\nNo fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery world\r\nthat can hold, man. What\u2019s Prometheus about there?\u2014the blacksmith,\r\nI mean\u2014what\u2019s he about?\r\n\n\r\nHe must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.\r\n\n\r\nRight. It\u2019s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce\r\nred flame there!\r\n\n\r\nAye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.\r\n\n\r\nUm-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old Greek,\r\nPrometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith, and animated\r\nthem with fire; for what\u2019s made in fire must properly belong to fire; and\r\nso hell\u2019s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the remainder the\r\nGreek made the Africans of. Carpenter, when he\u2019s through with that\r\nbuckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder-blades; there\u2019s a\r\npedlar aboard with a crushing pack.\r\n\n\r\nSir?\r\n\n\r\nHold; while Prometheus is about it, I\u2019ll order a complete man after a\r\ndesirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest modelled\r\nafter the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to \u2019em, to stay in one\r\nplace; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass\r\nforehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me\r\nsee\u2014shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of\r\nhis head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.\r\n\n\r\nNow, what\u2019s he speaking about, and who\u2019s he speaking to, I should\r\nlike to know? Shall I keep standing here? (aside).\r\n\n\r\n\u2019Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here\u2019s one.\r\nNo, no, no; I must have a lantern.\r\n\n\r\nHo, ho! That\u2019s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.\r\n\n\r\nWhat art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man? Thrusted\r\nlight is worse than presented pistols.\r\n\n\r\nI thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.\r\n\n\r\nCarpenter? why that\u2019s\u2014but no;\u2014a very tidy, and, I may say, an\r\nextremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;\u2014or\r\nwould\u2019st thou rather work in clay?\r\n\n\r\nSir?\u2014Clay? clay, sir? That\u2019s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.\r\n\n\r\nThe fellow\u2019s impious! What art thou sneezing about?\r\n\n\r\nBone is rather dusty, sir.\r\n\n\r\nTake the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under living\r\npeople\u2019s noses.\r\n\n\r\nSir?\u2014oh! ah!\u2014I guess so; so;\u2014yes, yes\u2014oh dear!\r\n\n\r\nLook ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike\r\nworkman, eh! Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for thy work, if, when I\r\ncome to mount this leg thou makest, I shall nevertheless feel another leg in\r\nthe same identical place with it; that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the\r\nflesh and blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive that old Adam away?\r\n\n\r\nTruly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard something\r\ncurious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the\r\nfeeling of his old spar, but it will be still pricking him at times. May I\r\nhumbly ask if it be really so, sir?\r\n\n\r\nIt is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was; so,\r\nnow, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the soul. Where thou\r\nfeelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a hair, do I. Is\u2019t\r\na riddle?\r\n\n\r\nI should humbly call it a poser, sir.\r\n\n\r\nHist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing may not\r\nbe invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now\r\nstandest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most solitary hours,\r\nthen, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don\u2019t speak! And if I still\r\nfeel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why\r\nmayest not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without\r\na body? Hah!\r\n\n\r\nGood Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again; I\r\nthink I didn\u2019t carry a small figure, sir.\r\n\n\r\nLook ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.\u2014How long before this\r\nleg is done?\r\n\n\r\nPerhaps an hour, sir.\r\n\n\r\nBungle away at it then, and bring it to me (turns to go). Oh, Life! Here\r\nI am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone\r\nto stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not do away\r\nwith ledgers. I would be free as air; and I\u2019m down in the whole\r\nworld\u2019s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the\r\nwealthiest Pr\u00e6torians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was the\r\nworld\u2019s); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By\r\nheavens! I\u2019ll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to\r\none small, compendious vertebra. So.\r\n\n\r\nCARPENTER (resuming his work).\r\n\n\r\nWell, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he\u2019s\r\nqueer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he\u2019s\r\nqueer, says Stubb; he\u2019s queer\u2014queer, queer; and keeps dinning it\r\ninto Mr. Starbuck all the time\u2014queer, sir\u2014queer, queer, very queer.\r\nAnd here\u2019s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here\u2019s his\r\nbedfellow! has a stick of whale\u2019s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his\r\nleg; he\u2019ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in\r\nthree places, and all three places standing in one hell\u2014how was that? Oh!\r\nI don\u2019t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I\u2019m a sort of\r\nstrange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that\u2019s only haphazard-like.\r\nThen, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out into\r\ndeep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you under the\r\nchin pretty quick, and there\u2019s a great cry for life-boats. And\r\nhere\u2019s the heron\u2019s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most\r\nfolks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them\r\nmercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses.\r\nBut Ahab; oh he\u2019s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to death, and\r\nspavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord. Halloa,\r\nthere, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and let\u2019s finish it\r\nbefore the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true\r\nor false, as brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill\r\n\u2019em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a real live leg, filed\r\ndown to nothing but the core; he\u2019ll be standing on this to-morrow;\r\nhe\u2019ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little oval\r\nslate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So, so; chisel, file,\r\nand sand-paper, now!CHAPTER CIX.AHAB AND STARBUCK IN THE CABIN\n\r\nAccording to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no\r\ninconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have sprung a\r\nbad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to\r\nreport this unfavorable affair.[22]\n\n\n [22]\r\nIn Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it is a\r\nregular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the casks\r\nwith sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed by the\r\nship\u2019s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight; while\r\nby the changed character of the withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect\r\nany serious leakage in the precious cargo.\r\n\n\r\nNow, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and the\r\nBashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the China\r\nwaters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the\r\noriental archipelagoes spread before him; and another separate one representing\r\nthe long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands\u2014Niphon, Matsmai, and\r\nSikoke. With his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his\r\ntable, and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous\r\nold man, with his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing\r\nhis old courses again.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d hearing the footstep at the door, but not\r\nturning round to it. \u201cOn deck! Begone!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We\r\nmust up Burtons and break out.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUp Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here\r\nfor a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEither do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good\r\nin a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving,\r\nsir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSo it is, so it is; if we get it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak!\r\nI\u2019m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks,\r\nbut those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that\u2019s a far worse plight\r\nthan the Pequod\u2019s, man. Yet I don\u2019t stop to plug my leak; for who\r\ncan find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if found, in\r\nthis life\u2019s howling gale? Starbuck! I\u2019ll not have the Burtons\r\nhoisted.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat will the owners say, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What\r\ncares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck, about\r\nthose miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But look ye, the\r\nonly real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in\r\nthis ship\u2019s keel.\u2014On deck!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said the reddening mate, moving further into the\r\ncabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed\r\nnot only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of\r\nitself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself; \u201cA\r\nbetter man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough\r\nresent in a younger man; aye! and in a happier, Captain Ahab.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDevils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of\r\nme?\u2014On deck!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir\u2014to be\r\nforbearing! Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto, Captain\r\nAhab?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAhab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most\r\nSouth-Sea-men\u2019s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,\r\nexclaimed: \u201cThere is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one Captain\r\nthat is lord over the Pequod.\u2014On deck!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks, you\r\nwould have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled\r\ntube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the\r\ncabin, paused for an instant and said: \u201cThou hast outraged, not insulted\r\nme, Sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but\r\nlaugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery\r\nthat!\u201d murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. \u201cWhat\u2019s that\r\nhe said\u2014Ahab beware of Ahab\u2014there\u2019s something there!\u201d\r\nThen unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to\r\nand fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead\r\nrelaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,\u201d he said lowly to the\r\nmate; then raising his voice to the crew: \u201cFurl the t\u2019gallant-sails\r\nand close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burtons, and\r\nbreak out in the main-hold.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting\r\nStarbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him; or mere\r\nprudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously forbade the\r\nslightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient, in the important\r\nchief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders were executed; and the\r\nBurtons were hoisted.CHAPTER CX.QUEEQUEG IN HIS COFFIN\n\r\nUpon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were\r\nperfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it being calm\r\nweather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the huge\r\nground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles\r\ninto the daylight above. So deep did they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and\r\nweedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked next for\r\nsome mouldy corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of\r\nthe posted placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.\r\nTierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves,\r\nand iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were\r\nhard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were\r\ntreading over empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an\r\nair-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all\r\nAristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.\r\n\n\r\nNow, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast bosom-friend,\r\nQueequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh to his endless end.\r\n\n\r\nBe it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown; dignity\r\nand danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the higher you rise the\r\nharder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer, must not only face\r\nall the rage of the living whale, but\u2014as we have elsewhere\r\nseen\u2014mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and finally descend into the\r\ngloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous\r\nconfinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage.\r\nTo be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.\r\n\n\r\nPoor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have\r\nstooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped to\r\nhis woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness\r\nand slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well. And a well, or\r\nan ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for\r\nall the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a\r\nfever; and at last, after some days\u2019 suffering, laid him in his hammock,\r\nclose to the very sill of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in\r\nthose few long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his\r\nframe and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew\r\nsharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became\r\nof a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there\r\nfrom his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which\r\ncould not die, or be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they\r\ngrow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings\r\nof Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the\r\nside of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any\r\nbeheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly wondrous\r\nand fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And the drawing near\r\nof Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation,\r\nwhich only an author from the dead could adequately tell. So that\u2014let us\r\nsay it again\u2014no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts\r\nthan those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor\r\nQueequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed\r\ngently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean\u2019s invisible\r\nflood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.\r\n\n\r\nNot a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what he\r\nthought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favor he asked. He called\r\none to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just breaking, and\r\ntaking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain\r\nlittle canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon\r\ninquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in\r\nthose same dark canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased\r\nhim; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a\r\ndead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated\r\naway to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars\r\nare isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild,\r\nuncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the white\r\nbreakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the thought of being\r\nburied in his hammock, according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something\r\nvile to the death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of\r\nNantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a\r\nwhale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but\r\nuncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.\r\n\n\r\nNow, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at\r\nonce commanded to do Queequeg\u2019s bidding, whatever it might include. There\r\nwas some heathenish, coffin-colored old lumber aboard, which, upon a long\r\nprevious voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday\r\nislands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made. No\r\nsooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he\r\nforthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into\r\nthe forecastle and took Queequeg\u2019s measure with great accuracy, regularly\r\nchalking Queequeg\u2019s person as he shifted the rule.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAh! poor fellow! he\u2019ll have to die now,\u201d ejaculated the Long\r\nIsland sailor.\r\n\n\r\nGoing to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience\u2019 sake and general\r\nreference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to\r\nbe, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its\r\nextremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work.\r\n\n\r\nWhen the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he lightly\r\nshouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether they were\r\nready for it yet in that direction.\r\n\n\r\nOverhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck\r\nbegan to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one\u2019s consternation,\r\ncommanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any\r\ndenying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most\r\ntyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly trouble us so little for\r\nevermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.\r\n\n\r\nLeaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an\r\nattentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from\r\nit, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the\r\npaddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged\r\nround the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a\r\nsmall bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of\r\nsail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted\r\ninto his final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He\r\nlay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out\r\nhis little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between,\r\nhe called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The\r\nhead part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his\r\ncoffin with little but his composed countenance in view. \u201cRarmai\u201d\r\n(it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his\r\nhammock.\r\n\n\r\nBut ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this while,\r\ndrew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by the hand; in\r\nthe other, holding his tambourine.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPoor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? Where go\r\nye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches\r\nare only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for me? Seek out\r\none Pip, who\u2019s now been missing long: I think he\u2019s in those far\r\nAntilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look!\r\nhe\u2019s left his tambourine behind;\u2014I found it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!\r\nNow, Queequeg, die; and I\u2019ll beat ye your dying march.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have heard,\u201d murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle,\r\n\u201cthat in violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient\r\ntongues; and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their\r\nwholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in\r\ntheir hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this\r\nstrange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly\r\nhomes. Where learned he that, but there?\u2014Hark! he speaks again: but more\r\nwildly now.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cForm two and two! Let\u2019s make a General of him! Ho, where\u2019s\r\nhis harpoon? Lay it across here.\u2014Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a\r\ngame cock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!\u2014mind ye\r\nthat; Queequeg dies game!\u2014take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game!\r\nI say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all\r\na\u2019shiver;\u2014out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the\r\nAntilles he\u2019s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he\r\njumped from a whale-boat! I\u2019d never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and\r\nhail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all\r\ncowards\u2014shame upon them! Let \u2019em go drown like Pip, that jumped\r\nfrom a whale-boat. Shame! shame!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDuring all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was led\r\naway, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\r\n\n\r\nBut now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that his\r\ncoffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no\r\nneed of the carpenter\u2019s box: and thereupon, when some expressed their\r\ndelighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden\r\nconvalescence was this;\u2014at a critical moment, he had just recalled a\r\nlittle duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore had changed his\r\nmind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They asked him, then,\r\nwhether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He\r\nanswered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg\u2019s conceit, that if a man\r\nmade up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a\r\nwhale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of\r\nthat sort.\r\n\n\r\nNow, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized; that\r\nwhile a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally speaking,\r\na sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good time my Queequeg\r\ngained strength; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent\r\ndays (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,\r\nthrew out arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit,\r\nand then springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,\r\npronounced himself fit for a fight.\r\n\n\r\nWith a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and emptying\r\ninto it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many spare hours he\r\nspent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings;\r\nand it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of\r\nthe twisted tattooing on his body. And this tattooing, had been the work of a\r\ndeparted prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had\r\nwritten out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a\r\nmystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own\r\nproper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose\r\nmysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart beat against\r\nthem; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away\r\nwith the living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to\r\nthe last. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild\r\nexclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor\r\nQueequeg\u2014\u201cOh, devilish tantalization of the gods!\u201dCHAPTER CXI.THE PACIFIC\n\r\nWhen gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea;\r\nwere it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific with\r\nuncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was answered; that\r\nserene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue.\r\n\n\r\nThere is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently awful\r\nstirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those fabled\r\nundulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St. John. And meet\r\nit is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and\r\nPotters\u2019 Fields of all four continents, the waves should rise and fall,\r\nand ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows,\r\ndrowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls, lie\r\ndreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds; the\r\never-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.\r\n\n\r\nTo any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must ever\r\nafter be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the world, the\r\nIndian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves wash the moles of\r\nthe new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of\r\nmen, and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than\r\nAbraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying,\r\nendless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious,\r\ndivine Pacific zones the world\u2019s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one\r\nbay to it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal\r\nswells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.\r\n\n\r\nBut few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab\u2019s brain, as standing like an iron\r\nstatue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one nostril he\r\nunthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles (in whose sweet\r\nwoods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other consciously inhaled the\r\nsalt breath of the new found sea; that sea in which the hated White Whale must\r\neven then be swimming. Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and\r\ngliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man\u2019s purpose\r\nintensified itself. His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his\r\nforehead\u2019s veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his\r\nringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, \u201cStern all! the White Whale\r\nspouts thick blood!\u201dCHAPTER CXII.THE BLACKSMITH\n\r\nThe blacksmith availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now\r\nreigned in these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active\r\npursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old\r\nblacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after\r\nconcluding his contributory work for Ahab\u2019s leg, but still retained it on\r\ndeck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost incessantly\r\ninvoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for\r\nthem; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various weapons and boat\r\nfurniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be\r\nserved; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously\r\nwatching his every sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old\r\nman\u2019s was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no\r\nimpatience, no petulence did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing\r\nover still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were\r\nlife itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his\r\nheart. And so it was.\u2014Most miserable!\r\n\n\r\nA peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing yawing\r\nin his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the\r\nmariners. And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally\r\ngiven in; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of\r\nhis wretched fate.\r\n\n\r\nBelated, and not innocently, one bitter winter\u2019s midnight, on the road\r\nrunning between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly\r\nnumbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn.\r\nThe issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet. Out of this\r\nrevelation, part by part, at last came out the four acts of the gladness, and\r\nthe one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his\r\nlife\u2019s drama.\r\n\n\r\nHe was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered\r\nthat thing in sorrow\u2019s technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan of\r\nfamed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a\r\nyouthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every\r\nSunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove. But one night,\r\nunder cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement,\r\na desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them all of\r\neverything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly\r\nconduct this burglar into his family\u2019s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror!\r\nUpon the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up\r\nhis home. Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the\r\nblacksmith\u2019s shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a\r\nseparate entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife\r\nlistened with no unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout\r\nringing of her young-armed old husband\u2019s hammer; whose reverberations,\r\nmuffled by passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,\r\nin her nursery; and so, to stout Labor\u2019s iron lullaby, the\r\nblacksmith\u2019s infants were rocked to slumber.\r\n\n\r\nOh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst thou\r\ntaken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then had\r\nthe young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable,\r\nlegendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing\r\ncompetency. But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose\r\nwhistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and\r\nleft the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life\r\nshould make him easier to harvest.\r\n\n\r\nWhy tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and\r\nmore between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the wife sat\r\nfrozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing into the weeping\r\nfaces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the\r\nhouse was sold; the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her\r\nchildren twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man\r\nstaggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a\r\nscorn to flaxen curls!\r\n\n\r\nDeath seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is only\r\na launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but the first\r\nsalutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the Watery,\r\nthe Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men, who still have\r\nleft in them some interior compunctions against suicide, does the\r\nall-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain\r\nof unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from\r\nthe hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to\r\nthem\u2014\u201cCome hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the\r\nguilt of intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for\r\nthem. Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred\r\nand abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put up\r\nthy grave-stone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till we\r\nmarry thee!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sun-rise, and by fall of\r\neve, the blacksmith\u2019s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth went\r\na-whaling.CHAPTER CXIII.THE FORGE\n\r\nWith matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about mid-day,\r\nPerth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed upon an\r\niron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and with the\r\nother at his forge\u2019s lungs, when captain Ahab came along, carrying in his\r\nhand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a little distance from the\r\nforge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the\r\nfire, began hammering it upon the anvil\u2014the red mass sending off the\r\nsparks in thick hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAre these thy Mother Carey\u2019s chickens, Perth? they are always\r\nflying in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;\u2014look here,\r\nthey burn; but thou\u2014thou liv\u2019st among them without a scorch.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBecause I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,\u201d answered Perth,\r\nresting for a moment on his hammer; \u201cI am past scorching; not easily\r\ncan\u2019st thou scorch a scar.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woful to\r\nme. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others that is not\r\nmad. Thou should\u2019st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad?\r\nHow can\u2019st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee,\r\nthat thou can\u2019st not go mad?\u2014What wert thou making there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWelding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd can\u2019st thou make it all smooth, again, blacksmith, after such\r\nhard usage as it had?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI think so, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd I suppose thou can\u2019st smoothe almost any seams and dents;\r\nnever mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook ye here,\u201d then, cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and\r\nleaning with both hands on Perth\u2019s shoulders; \u201clook ye\r\nhere\u2014here\u2014can ye smoothe out a seam like this,\r\nblacksmith,\u201d sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow; \u201cif thou\r\ncould\u2019st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and\r\nfeel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes. Answer! Can\u2019st thou smoothe\r\nthis seam?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though\r\nthou only see\u2019st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone of\r\nmy skull\u2014that is all wrinkles! But, away with child\u2019s play;\r\nno more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!\u201d jingling the leathern bag,\r\nas if it were full of gold coins. \u201cI, too, want a harpoon made; one that\r\na thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will stick in a\r\nwhale like his own fin-bone. There\u2019s the stuff,\u201d flinging the pouch\r\nupon the anvil. \u201cLook ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs\r\nof the steel shoes of racing horses.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHorse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the\r\nbest and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the\r\nmelted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me first,\r\ntwelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve\r\ntogether like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I\u2019ll blow the\r\nfire.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by\r\nspiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. \u201cA\r\nflaw!\u201d rejecting the last one. \u201cWork that over again, Perth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThis done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab\r\nstayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, with regular,\r\ngasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods,\r\none after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense\r\nstraight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards\r\nthe fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab\r\nlooked up, he slid aside.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?\u201d\r\nmuttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. \u201cThat Parsee smells fire\r\nlike a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket\u2019s\r\npowder-pan.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as Perth,\r\nto temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by, the\r\nscalding steam shot up into Ahab\u2019s bent face.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWould\u2019st thou brand me, Perth?\u201d wincing for a moment with\r\nthe pain; \u201chave I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this\r\nharpoon for the White Whale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself,\r\nman. Here are my razors\u2014the best of steel; here, and make the barbs sharp\r\nas the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFor a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not\r\nuse them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,\r\nnor pray till\u2014but here\u2014to work!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank, the\r\nsteel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was about giving\r\nthe barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place\r\nthe water-cask near.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no\u2014no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper.\r\nAhoy, there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me\r\nas much blood as will cover this barb?\u201d holding it high up. A cluster of\r\ndark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the\r\nWhite Whale\u2019s barbs were then tempered.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEgo non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!\u201d\r\ndeliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the\r\nbaptismal blood.\r\n\n\r\nNow, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory, with\r\nthe bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron. A\r\ncoil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it taken to the\r\nwindlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot upon it, till the\r\nrope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no\r\nstrandings, Ahab exclaimed, \u201cGood! and now for the seizings.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns were\r\nall braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was then driven\r\nhard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was traced half way along\r\nthe pole\u2019s length, and firmly secured so, with intertwistings of twine.\r\nThis done, pole, iron, and rope\u2014like the Three Fates\u2014remained\r\ninseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his\r\nivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every\r\nplank. But ere he entered his cabin, a light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet\r\nmost piteous sound was heard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but\r\nunresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black\r\ntragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!CHAPTER CXIV.THE GILDER\n\r\nPenetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground,\r\nthe Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild, pleasant weather,\r\nfor twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the stretch, they were\r\nengaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the\r\nwhales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their\r\nuprising; though with but small success for their pains.\r\n\n\r\nAt such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow heaving\r\nswells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so sociably mixing with\r\nthe soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone cats they purr against the\r\ngunwale; these are the times of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil\r\nbeauty and brilliancy of the ocean\u2019s skin, one forgets the tiger heart\r\nthat pants beneath it; and would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw\r\nbut conceals a remorseless fang.\r\n\n\r\nThese are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain\r\nfilial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he regards it as so\r\nmuch flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts,\r\nseems struggling forward, not through high rolling waves, but through the tall\r\ngrass of a rolling prairie: as when the western emigrants\u2019 horses only\r\nshow their erected ears, while their hidden bodies widely wade through the\r\namazing verdure.\r\n\n\r\nThe long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these there\r\nsteals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied children lie\r\nsleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when the flowers of the\r\nwoods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so that fact\r\nand fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.\r\n\n\r\nNor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary\r\nan effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his\r\nown secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but\r\ntarnishing.\r\n\n\r\nOh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in\r\nye,\u2014though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,\u2014in\r\nye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some few\r\nfleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to God\r\nthese blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of life are\r\nwoven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm. There\r\nis no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed\r\ngradations, and at the last one pause:\u2014through infancy\u2019s\r\nunconscious spell, boyhood\u2019s thoughtless faith, adolescence\u2019 doubt\r\n(the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in\r\nmanhood\u2019s pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the\r\nround again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the\r\nfinal harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of\r\nwhich the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling\u2019s father\r\nhidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing\r\nthem: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to\r\nlearn it.\r\n\n\r\nAnd that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat\u2019s side into that\r\nsame golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLoveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride\u2019s\r\neye!\u2014Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal\r\nways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do\r\nbelieve.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden\r\nlight:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that\r\nhe has always been jolly!\u201dCHAPTER CXV.THE PEQUOD MEETS THE BACHELOR\n\r\nAnd jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before\r\nthe wind, some few weeks after Ahab\u2019s harpoon had been welded.\r\n\n\r\nIt was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last cask\r\nof oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad holiday apparel,\r\nwas joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing round among the\r\nwidely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing her prow for home.\r\n\n\r\nThe three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at\r\ntheir hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and\r\nhanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale\r\nthey had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colors were flying from her\r\nrigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were\r\ntwo barrels of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender\r\nbreakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen\r\nlamp.\r\n\n\r\nAs was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising\r\nsuccess; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas\r\nnumerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish.\r\nNot only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far\r\nmore valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for,\r\nfrom the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the\r\ncaptain\u2019s and officers\u2019 staterooms. Even the cabin table itself had\r\nbeen knocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of\r\nan oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the\r\nsailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was\r\nhumorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and\r\nfilled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it;\r\nthat the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them;\r\nthat indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain\u2019s\r\npantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in\r\nself-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.\r\n\n\r\nAs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the barbarian\r\nsound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing still nearer, a\r\ncrowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots, which, covered\r\nwith the parchment-like poke or stomach skin of the black fish, gave\r\nforth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew. On the\r\nquarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls\r\nwho had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an\r\nornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three\r\nLong Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding\r\nover the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship\u2019s company were\r\ntumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had\r\nbeen removed. You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed\r\nBastile, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were\r\nbeing hurled into the sea.\r\n\n\r\nLord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the\r\nship\u2019s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was full\r\nbefore him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion.\r\n\n\r\nAnd Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with a\r\nstubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other\u2019s wakes\u2014one\r\nall jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things to\r\ncome\u2014their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking\r\ncontrast of the scene.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCome aboard, come aboard!\u201d cried the gay Bachelor\u2019s\r\ncommander, lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d gritted Ahab in reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo; only heard of him; but don\u2019t believe in him at all,\u201d\r\nsaid the other good-humoredly. \u201cCome aboard!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThou are too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot enough to speak of\u2014two islanders, that\u2019s all;\u2014but\r\ncome aboard, old hearty, come along. I\u2019ll soon take that black from your\r\nbrow. Come along, will ye (merry\u2019s the play); a full ship and\r\nhomeward-bound.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow wondrous familiar is a fool!\u201d muttered Ahab; then aloud,\r\n\u201cThou art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayest; well, then, call\r\nme an empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward\r\nthere! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\r\nstubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew of the\r\nPequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding Bachelor; but\r\nthe Bachelor\u2019s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they\r\nwere in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft,\r\nhe took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to\r\nthe vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that\r\nvial was filled with Nantucket soundings.CHAPTER CXVI.THE DYING WHALE\n\r\nNot seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune\u2019s favorites\r\nsail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the rushing\r\nbreeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed it with the\r\nPequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales were seen and\r\nfour were slain; and one of them by Ahab.\r\n\n\r\nIt was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight\r\nwere done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and whale both\r\nstilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such plaintiveness, such\r\ninwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far\r\nover from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish\r\nland-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these\r\nvesper hymns.\r\n\n\r\nSoothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off from\r\nthe whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat.\r\nFor that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying\u2014the\r\nturning sunwards of the head, and so expiring\u2014that strange spectacle,\r\nbeheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness\r\nunknown before.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe turns and turns him to it,\u2014how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\r\nhomage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too\r\nworships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!\u2014Oh that\r\nthese too-favoring eyes should see these too-favoring sights. Look! here, far\r\nwater-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in these most candid and\r\nimpartial seas; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets; where for long\r\nChinese ages, the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as\r\nstars that shine upon the Niger\u2019s unknown source; here, too, life dies\r\nsunwards full of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the\r\ncorpse, and it heads some other way.\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded\r\nthy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas; thou art\r\nan infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering\r\nTyphoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor has this thy whale\r\nsunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round again, without a lesson to\r\nme.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed\r\njet!\u2014that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In vain, oh whale,\r\ndost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun, that only calls forth\r\nlife, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock me with a\r\nprouder, if a darker faith. All thy unnamable imminglings, float beneath me\r\nhere; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water\r\nnow.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl\r\nfinds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though hill and\r\nvalley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!\u201dCHAPTER CXVII.THE WHALE WATCH\n\r\nThe four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to windward;\r\none, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These last three were\r\nbrought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not be reached till\r\nmorning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that\r\nboat was Ahab\u2019s.\r\n\n\r\nThe waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale\u2019s spout-hole; and\r\nthe lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon the\r\nblack, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently chafed\r\nthe whale\u2019s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.\r\n\n\r\nAhab and all his boat\u2019s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching\r\nin the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the whale,\r\nand tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like the moaning in\r\nsquadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\n\r\nStarted from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped round\r\nby the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world. \u201cI\r\nhave dreamed it again,\u201d said he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOf the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin\r\ncan be thine?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd who are hearsed that die on the sea?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two\r\nhearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by mortal\r\nhands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:\u2014a hearse and its plumes\r\nfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a sight\r\nwe shall not soon see.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBelieve it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd what was that saying about thyself?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThough it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy\r\npilot.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd when thou art so gone before\u2014if that ever befall\u2014then\r\nere I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?\u2014Was it\r\nnot so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two\r\npledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTake another pledge, old man,\u201d said the Parsee, as his eyes\r\nlighted up like fire-flies in the gloom,\u2014\u201cHemp only can kill\r\nthee.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe gallows, ye mean.\u2014I am immortal then, on land and on\r\nsea,\u201d cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;\u2014\u201cImmortal on land\r\nand on sea!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBoth were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the slumbering\r\ncrew arose from the boat\u2019s bottom, and ere noon the dead whale was\r\nbrought to the ship.CHAPTER CXVIII.THE QUADRANT\n\r\nThe season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab, coming\r\nfrom his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously\r\nhandle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces, and would\r\nstand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon;\r\nimpatient for the order to point the ship\u2019s prow for the equator. In good\r\ntime the order came. It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows\r\nof his high-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily obervation of the\r\nsun to determine his latitude.\r\n\n\r\nNow, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences.\r\nThat unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy\r\nocean\u2019s immeasureable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered; clouds\r\nthere are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance\r\nis as the insufferable splendors of God\u2019s throne. Well that Ahab\u2019s\r\nquadrant was furnished with colored glasses, through which to take sight of\r\nthat solar fire. So, swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with\r\nhis astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that\r\nposture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain\r\nits precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the\r\nParsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship\u2019s deck, and with face thrown\r\nup like Ahab\u2019s, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his\r\neyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly\r\npassionlessness. At length the desired observation was taken; and with his\r\npencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at\r\nthat precise instant. Then falling into a moment\u2019s revery, he again\r\nlooked up towards the sun and murmured to himself: \u201cThou sea-mark! thou\r\nhigh and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I am\u2014but canst\r\nthou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or canst thou tell where some\r\nother thing besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant\r\nthou must be eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even\r\nnow beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the\r\nobjects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its numerous\r\ncabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered: \u201cFoolish toy!\r\nbabies\u2019 plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and Captains; the\r\nworld brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what after all canst thou\r\ndo, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou thyself happenest to be on\r\nthis wide planet, and the hand that holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou\r\ncanst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow\r\nnoon; and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee,\r\nthou vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast man\u2019s eyes aloft to\r\nthat heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even\r\nnow scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth\u2019s\r\nhorizon are the glances of man\u2019s eyes; not shot from the crown of his\r\nhead, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou\r\nquadrant!\u201d dashing it to the deck, \u201cno longer will I guide my\r\nearthly way by thee; the level ship\u2019s compass, and the level\r\ndead-reckoning, by log and by line; these shall conduct me, and show me\r\nmy place on the sea. Aye,\u201d lighting from the boat to the deck,\r\n\u201cthus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high;\r\nthus I split and destroy thee!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead\r\nfeet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a fatalistic despair\r\nthat seemed meant for himself\u2014these passed over the mute, motionless\r\nParsee\u2019s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away; while, awestruck by\r\nthe aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered together on the forecastle,\r\ntill Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out\u2014\u201cTo the braces!\r\nUp helm!\u2014square in!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon her\r\nheel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long, ribbed\r\nhull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed.\r\n\n\r\nStanding between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod\u2019s\r\ntumultuous way, and Ahab\u2019s also, as he went lurching along the deck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full of\r\nits tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down, down, to\r\ndumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine, what will at\r\nlength remain but one little heap of ashes!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye,\u201d cried Stubb, \u201cbut sea-coal ashes\u2014mind ye that,\r\nMr. Starbuck\u2014sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab\r\nmutter, \u2018Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine;\r\nswears that I must play them, and no others.\u2019 And damn me, Ahab, but thou\r\nactest right; live in the game, and die it!\u201dCHAPTER CXIX.THE CANDLES\n\r\nWarmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal crouches in\r\nspiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgent but basket the\r\ndeadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame\r\nnorthern lands. So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese seas the\r\nmariner encounters the direst of all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes\r\nburst from out that cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and\r\nsleepy town.\r\n\n\r\nTowards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and bare-poled\r\nwas left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly ahead. When darkness\r\ncame on, sky and sea roared and split with the thunder, and blazed with the\r\nlightning, that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the\r\nrags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport.\r\n\n\r\nHolding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every flash\r\nof the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster might have\r\nbefallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were directing the\r\nmen in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats. But all their pains\r\nseemed naught. Though lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward\r\nquarter boat (Ahab\u2019s) did not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high\r\nup against the reeling ship\u2019s high tetering side, stove in the\r\nboat\u2019s bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through like\r\na sieve.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBad work, bad work!\u201d Mr. Starbuck, said Stubb, regarding the\r\nwreck, \u201cbut the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can\u2019t fight\r\nit. You see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,\r\nall round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, all the\r\nstart I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But never mind;\r\nit\u2019s all in fun: so the old song says;\u201d\u2014(sings.)\r\n\n\r\nOh! jolly is the gale,\r\nAnd a joker is the whale,\r\nA\u2019 flourishin\u2019 his tail,\u2014\r\nSuch a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\r\n\n\r\nThe scud all a flyin\u2019,\r\nThat\u2019s his flip only foamin\u2019;\r\nWhen he stirs in the spicin\u2019,\u2014\r\nSuch a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\r\n\n\r\nThunder splits the ships,\r\nBut he only smacks his lips,\r\nA tastin\u2019 of this flip,\u2014\r\nSuch a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAvast Stubb,\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201clet the Typhoon sing, and\r\nstrike his harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold\r\nthy peace.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;\r\nand I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr. Starbuck,\r\nthere\u2019s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat. And\r\nwhen that\u2019s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMadman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never\r\nmind how foolish?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing\r\nhis hand towards the weather bow, \u201cmarkest thou not that the gale comes\r\nfrom the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very\r\ncourse he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is that stove?\r\nIn the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand\u2014his stand-point is\r\nstove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou must!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t half understand ye: what\u2019s in the wind?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\r\nNantucket,\u201d soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb\u2019s\r\nquestion. \u201cThe gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it\r\ninto a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward, all is\r\nblackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward\u2014I see it lightens up there;\r\nbut not with the lightning.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the\r\nflashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a volley\r\nof thunder peals rolled overhead.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOld Thunder!\u201d said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\r\npivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances\r\nof fire.\r\n\n\r\nNow, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the\r\nperilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry\r\nto each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But as this conductor\r\nmust descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all contact with the\r\nhull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to\r\nmany mishaps, besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and\r\nmore or less impeding the vessel\u2019s way in the water; because of all this,\r\nthe lower parts of a ship\u2019s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but\r\nare generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled\r\nup into the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may\r\nrequire.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe rods! the rods!\u201d cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly\r\nadmonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting\r\nflambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. \u201cAre they overboard? drop them\r\nover, fore and aft. Quick!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAvast!\u201d cried Ahab; \u201clet\u2019s have fair play here, though\r\nwe be the weaker side. Yet I\u2019ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs\r\nand Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them\r\nbe, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook aloft!\u201d cried Starbuck. \u201cThe corpusants! the\r\ncorpusants!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\r\ntri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of the\r\nthree tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like three\r\ngigantic wax tapers before an altar.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBlast the boat! let it go!\u201d cried Stubb at this instant, as a\r\nswashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale\r\nviolently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. \u201cBlast\r\nit!\u201d\u2014but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught\r\nthe flames; and immediately shifting his tone, he cried\u2014\u201cThe\r\ncorpusants have mercy on us all!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTo sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of the\r\ncalm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses from the\r\ntopsail-yard-arms, when most they teter over to a seething sea; but in all my\r\nvoyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God\u2019s burning finger\r\nhas been laid on the ship; when His \u201cMene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin\u201d\r\nhas been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.\r\n\n\r\nWhile this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the\r\nenchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all their\r\neyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away constellation of\r\nstars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, Daggoo,\r\nloomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed the black cloud from which the\r\nthunder had come. The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth,\r\nwhich strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit\r\nup by the preternatural light, Queequeg\u2019s tattooing burned like Satanic\r\nblue flames on his body.\r\n\n\r\nThe tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the\r\nPequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two\r\npassed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb.\r\n\u201cWhat thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in the\r\nsong.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, it wasn\u2019t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and\r\nI hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?\u2014have\r\nthey no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck\u2014but it\u2019s too\r\ndark to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of\r\ngood luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock\r\na\u2019 block with sperm-oil, d\u2019ye see; and so, all that sperm will work\r\nup into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will yet be as\r\nthree spermaceti candles\u2014that\u2019s the good promise we saw.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAt that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb\u2019s face slowly beginning to\r\nglimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: \u201cSee! see!\u201d and\r\nonce more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\r\nsupernaturalness in their pallor.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe corpusants have mercy on us all,\u201d cried Stubb, again.\r\n\n\r\nAt the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the\r\nparsee was kneeling in Ahab\u2019s front, but with his head bowed away from\r\nhim; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they had\r\njust been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the\r\nglare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps\r\nfrom a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like the\r\nstanding, or stepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained\r\nrooted to the deck; but all their eyes upcast.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye, men!\u201d cried Ahab. \u201cLook up at it; mark it well;\r\nthe white flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those main-mast\r\nlinks there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood\r\nagainst fire! So.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThen turning\u2014the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot\r\nupon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm, he stood\r\nerect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian\r\nonce did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this\r\nhour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know that\r\nthy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind;\r\nand e\u2019en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed. No fearless\r\nfool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless, placeless power; but to the last\r\ngasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery\r\nin me. In the midst of the personified impersonal, a personality stands here.\r\nThough but a point at best; whencesoe\u2019er I came; wheresoe\u2019er I go;\r\nyet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her\r\nroyal rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of\r\nlove, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere supernal\r\npower; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there\u2019s\r\nthat in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire\r\nthou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to\r\nthee.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n[Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise to\r\nthrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes, his right\r\nhand pressed hard upon them.]\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung\r\nfrom me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can then grope.\r\nThou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of these poor\r\neyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning flashes through my\r\nskull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded,\r\nand rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to\r\nthee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness\r\nleaping out of light, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see,\r\nor not? There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now do I glory in my\r\ngenealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh,\r\ncruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but thine is\r\ngreater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten;\r\ncertainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I know that\r\nof me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some\r\nunsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy eternity is\r\nbut time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my\r\nscorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial,\r\nthou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again\r\nwith haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap\r\nwith thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I\r\nworship thee!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe boat! the boat!\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201clook at thy boat, old\r\nman!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAhab\u2019s harpoon, the one forged at Perth\u2019s fire, remained firmly\r\nlashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his\r\nwhale-boat\u2019s bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the\r\nloose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a\r\nlevelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a\r\nserpent\u2019s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm\u2014\u201cGod, God\r\nis against thee, old man; forbear! \u2019tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill\r\ncontinued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind\r\nof it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOverhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\r\nbraces\u2014though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast\r\nmate\u2019s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But\r\ndashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning\r\nharpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it\r\nthe first sailor that but cast loose a rope\u2019s end. Petrified by his\r\naspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell\r\nback in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:\u2014\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAll your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and\r\nheart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know\r\nto what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last\r\nfear!\u201d And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.\r\n\n\r\nAs in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of some\r\nlone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it so much the\r\nmore unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so at those last\r\nwords of Ahab\u2019s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of\r\ndismay.CHAPTER CXX.THE DECK TOWARDS THE END OF THE\r\nFIRST NIGHT WATCH\n\nAhab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him.\n\n\r\n\u201cWe must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working\r\nloose, and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStrike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I\u2019d sway them up\r\nnow.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir?\u2014in God\u2019s name!\u2014sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStrike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,\r\nbut it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.\u2014By\r\nmasts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting\r\nsmack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks were made\r\nfor wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud.\r\nShall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards send down their brain-trucks in\r\ntempest time. What a hooroosh aloft there! I would e\u2019en take it for\r\nsublime, did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine,\r\ntake medicine!\u201dCHAPTER CXXI.MIDNIGHT\u2014THE FORECASTLE BULWARKS\n\nStubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over the\r\nanchors there hanging.\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but you\r\nwill never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long ago is it\r\nsince you said the very contrary? Didn\u2019t you once say that whatever ship\r\nAhab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy,\r\njust as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers\r\nforward? Stop, now; didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell, suppose I did? What then? I\u2019ve part changed my flesh since\r\nthat time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we are loaded with powder\r\nbarrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get afire in\r\nthis drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty red hair, but\r\nyou couldn\u2019t get afire now. Shake yourself; you\u2019re Aquarius, or the\r\nwater-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat collar. Don\u2019t you\r\nsee, then, that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra\r\nguarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But hark, again, and I\u2019ll answer ye\r\nthe other thing. First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here,\r\nthough, so I can pass the rope; now listen. What\u2019s the mighty difference\r\nbetween holding a mast\u2019s lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close\r\nby a mast that hasn\u2019t got any lightning-rod at all in a storm?\r\nDon\u2019t you see, you timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of\r\nthe rod, unless the mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not\r\none ship in a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,\u2014aye, man, and all of\r\nus,\u2014were in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews\r\nin ten thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose\r\nyou would have every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod\r\nrunning up the corner of his hat, like a militia officer\u2019s skewered\r\nfeather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why don\u2019t ye be sensible,\r\nFlask? it\u2019s easy to be sensible; why don\u2019t ye, then? any man with\r\nhalf an eye can be sensible.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather\r\nhard.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYes, when a fellow\u2019s soaked through, it\u2019s hard to be\r\nsensible, that\u2019s a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never\r\nmind; catch the turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these\r\nanchors now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two\r\nanchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man\u2019s hands behind him. And what\r\nbig generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists, hey? What a\r\nhold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere;\r\nif she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable, though. There, hammer that\r\nknot down, and we\u2019ve done. So; next to touching land, lighting on deck is\r\nthe most satisfactory. I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank\r\nye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a long tailed coat\r\nought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way,\r\nserve to carry off the water, d\u2019ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks\r\nform gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for\r\nme; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew!\r\nthere goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from\r\nheaven should be so unmannerly! This is a nasty night, lad.\u201dCHAPTER CXXII.MIDNIGHT ALOFT\u2014THUNDER AND LIGHTNING\n\nThe Main-top-sail yard.\u2014Tashtego passing new lashings around it.\n\n\r\n\u201cUm, um, um. Stop that thunder! Plenty too much thunder up here.\r\nWhat\u2019s the use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don\u2019t want thunder; we\r\nwant rum; give us a glass of rum. Um, um, um!\u201dCHAPTER CXXIII.THE MUSKET\n\r\nDuring the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod\u2019s\r\njaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its\r\nspasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached to\r\nit\u2014for they were slack\u2014because some play to the tiller was\r\nindispensable.\r\n\n\r\nIn a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttle-cock to the\r\nblast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses, at\r\nintervals, go round and round. It was thus with the Pequod\u2019s; at almost\r\nevery shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with\r\nwhich they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly any one can\r\nbehold without some sort of unwonted emotion.\r\n\n\r\nSome hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the\r\nstrenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb\u2014one engaged forward and the\r\nother aft\u2014the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails\r\nwere cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like the\r\nfeathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when that\r\nstorm-tossed bird is on the wing.\r\n\n\r\nThe three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a storm-trysail\r\nwas set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the water with some\r\nprecision again; and the course\u2014for the present,\r\nEast-south-east\u2014which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more\r\ngiven to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only steered\r\naccording to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the ship as near her\r\ncourse as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind\r\nseemed coming round astern; aye! the foul breeze became fair!\r\n\n\r\nInstantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of \u201cHo! the fair\r\nwind! oh-he-yo, cheerly, men!\u201d the crew singing for joy, that so\r\npromising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding\r\nit.\r\n\n\r\nIn compliance with the standing order of his commander\u2014to report\r\nimmediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change in the\r\naffairs of the deck,\u2014Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the\r\nbreeze\u2014however reluctantly and gloomily,\u2014than he mechanically went\r\nbelow to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.\r\n\n\r\nEre knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a moment. The\r\ncabin lamp\u2014taking long swings this way and that\u2014was burning\r\nfitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man\u2019s bolted\r\ndoor,\u2014a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels.\r\nThe isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to\r\nreign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements. The\r\nloaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as they stood upright\r\nagainst the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of\r\nStarbuck\u2019s heart, at that instant when he saw the muskets, there\r\nstrangely evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or good\r\naccompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe would have shot me once,\u201d he murmured, \u201cyes,\r\nthere\u2019s the very musket that he pointed at me;\u2014that one with the\r\nstudded stock; let me touch it\u2014lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled\r\nso many deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see.\r\nAye, aye; and powder in the pan;\u2014that\u2019s not good. Best spill\r\nit?\u2014wait. I\u2019ll cure myself of this. I\u2019ll hold the musket\r\nboldly while I think.\u2014I come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair?\r\nFair for death and doom,\u2014that\u2019s fair for Moby Dick.\r\nIt\u2019s a fair wind that\u2019s only fair for that accursed fish.\u2014The\r\nvery tube he pointed at me!\u2014the very one; this one\u2014I hold it\r\nhere; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.\u2014Aye and\r\nhe would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike his spars\r\nto any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same\r\nperilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the\r\nerror-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that he would\r\nhave no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to\r\ndrag a whole ship\u2019s company down to doom with him?\u2014Yes, it would\r\nmake him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any\r\ndeadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab\r\nhave his way. If, then, he were this instant\u2014put aside, that crime would\r\nnot be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,\u2014in there,\r\nhe\u2019s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I\r\ncan\u2019t withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not\r\nentreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy\r\nown flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say\u2019st the men\r\nhave vow\u2019d thy vow; say\u2019st all of us are Ahabs. Great God\r\nforbid!\u2014But is there no other way? no lawful way?\u2014Make him a\r\nprisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man\u2019s living\r\npower from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were pinioned\r\neven; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on\r\nthis cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could\r\nnot endure the sight; could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep\r\nitself, inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What,\r\nthen, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the\r\nnearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole\r\ncontinent between me and law.\u2014Aye, aye, \u2019tis so.\u2014Is heaven a\r\nmurderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering\r\nsheets and skin together?\u2014And would I be a murderer, then,\r\nif\u201d\u2014and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed\r\nthe loaded musket\u2019s end against the door.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOn this level, Ahab\u2019s hammock swings within; his head this way. A\r\ntouch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.\u2014Oh Mary!\r\nMary!\u2014boy! boy! boy!\u2014But if I wake thee not to death, old man, who\r\ncan tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck\u2019s body this day week may sink,\r\nwith all the crew! Great God, where art thou? Shall I? shall I?\u2014The wind\r\nhas gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails are reefed and set;\r\nshe heads her course.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSuch were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man\u2019s\r\ntormented sleep, as if Starbuck\u2019s voice had caused the long dumb dream to\r\nspeak.\r\n\n\r\nThe yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard\u2019s arm against the panel;\r\nStarbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he placed\r\nthe death-tube in its rack, and left the place.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s too sound asleep, Mr Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and\r\ntell him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know\u2019st what to say.\u201dCHAPTER CXXIV.THE NEEDLE\n\r\nNext morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty\r\nbulk, and striving in the Pequod\u2019s gurgling track, pushed her on like\r\ngiants\u2019 palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so,\r\nthat sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed before\r\nthe wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was only known\r\nby the spread intensity of his place; where his bayonet rays moved on in\r\nstacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over\r\neverything. The sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps\r\nwith light and heat.\r\n\n\r\nLong maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time the\r\ntetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye the bright\r\nsun\u2019s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by the stern,\r\nhe turned behind, and saw the sun\u2019s rearward place, and how the same\r\nyellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHa, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of\r\nthe sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye! Yoke on\r\nthe further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the helm,\r\nhuskily demanding how the ship was heading.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cEast-sou-east, sir,\u201d said the frightened steersman.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThou liest!\u201d smiting him with his clenched fist. \u201cHeading\r\nEast at this hour in the morning, and the sun astern?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUpon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed by\r\nAhab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very blinding\r\npalpableness must have been the cause.\r\n\n\r\nThrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of the\r\ncompasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost seemed to\r\nstagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses pointed\r\nEast, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.\r\n\n\r\nBut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old man\r\nwith a rigid laugh exclaimed, \u201cI have it! It has happened before. Mr.\r\nStarbuck, last night\u2019s thunder turned our compasses\u2014that\u2019s\r\nall. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,\u201d said the pale\r\nmate, gloomily.\r\n\n\r\nHere, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than one\r\ncase occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as developed in\r\nthe mariner\u2019s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with the\r\nelectricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that\r\nsuch things should be. In instances where the lightning has actually struck the\r\nvessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the\r\nneedle has at times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being\r\nannihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old\r\nwife\u2019s knitting needle. But in either case, the needle never again, of\r\nitself, recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle\r\ncompasses be affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the\r\nship; even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.\r\n\n\r\nDeliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed\r\ncompasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the\r\nprecise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly\r\ninverted, shouted out his orders for the ship\u2019s course to be changed\r\naccordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her\r\nundaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only been\r\njuggling her.\r\n\n\r\nMeanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing, but\r\nquietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask\u2014who in some\r\nsmall degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings\u2014likewise\r\nunmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly rumbled,\r\ntheir fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as ever before, the\r\npagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was\r\nonly with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible\r\nAhab\u2019s.\r\n\n\r\nFor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But chancing to\r\nslip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the quadrant\r\nhe had the day before dashed to the deck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun\u2019s pilot! yesterday I wrecked\r\nthee, and to-day the compasses would feign have wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is\r\nlord over the level load-stone yet. Mr. Starbuck\u2014a lance without a pole;\r\na top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker\u2019s needles. Quick!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAccessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do,\r\nwere certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to revive the\r\nspirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a matter so wondrous\r\nas that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man well knew that to steer\r\nby transpointed needles, though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be\r\npassed over by superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil\r\nportents.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMen,\u201d said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed\r\nhim the things he had demanded, \u201cmy men, the thunder turned old\r\nAhab\u2019s needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his\r\nown, that will point as true as any.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAbashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this was\r\nsaid; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow. But\r\nStarbuck looked away.\r\n\n\r\nWith a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance, and\r\nthen handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him hold it upright,\r\nwithout its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after repeatedly smiting\r\nthe upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top\r\nof it, and less strongly hammered that, several times, the mate still holding\r\nthe rod as before. Then going through some small strange motions with\r\nit\u2014whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely\r\nintended to augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain\u2014he called for linen\r\nthread; and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,\r\nand horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the\r\ncompass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering and\r\nvibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who\r\nhad been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the\r\nbinnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,\r\nexclaimed,\u2014\u201cLook ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not the lord of the\r\nlevel loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nOne after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could persuade\r\nsuch ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.\r\n\n\r\nIn his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his fatal\r\npride.CHAPTER CXXV.THE LOG AND LINE\n\r\nWhile now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log and\r\nline had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance upon other\r\nmeans of determining the vessel\u2019s place, some merchantmen, and many\r\nwhalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log; though at\r\nthe same time, and frequently more for form\u2019s sake than anything else,\r\nregularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship,\r\nas well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour. It had been\r\nthus with the Pequod. The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long\r\nuntouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had\r\ndamped it; the sun and wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot\r\na thing that hung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as\r\nhe happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene, and\r\nhe remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about\r\nthe level log and line. The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows\r\nrolled in riots.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cForward, there! Heave the log!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTwo seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman. \u201cTake\r\nthe reel, one of ye, I\u2019ll heave.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThey went towards the extreme stern, on the ship\u2019s lee side, where the\r\ndeck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the\r\ncreamy, sidelong-rushing sea.\r\n\n\r\nThe Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting\r\nhandle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so stood\r\nwith the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.\r\n\n\r\nAhab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to\r\nform a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old Manxman, who was\r\nintently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to speak.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have\r\nspoiled it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201c\u2019Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled\r\nthee? Thou seem\u2019st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey\r\nhairs of mine \u2019tis not worth while disputing, \u2019specially with a\r\nsuperior, who\u2019ll ne\u2019er confess.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? There now\u2019s a patched professor in Queen\r\nNature\u2019s granite-founded College; but methinks he\u2019s too\r\nsubservient. Where wert thou born?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cExcellent! Thou\u2019st hit the world by that.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI know not, sir, but I was born there.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it\u2019s good.\r\nHere\u2019s a man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now\r\nunmanned of Man; which is sucked in\u2014by what? Up with the reel! The dead,\r\nblind wall butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging\r\nline astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In turn, jerkingly\r\nraised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing resistance of the log\r\ncaused the old reelman to stagger strangely.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHold hard!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSnap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging log\r\nwas gone.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea\r\nparts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel up,\r\nManxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend thou the\r\nline. See to it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere he goes now; to him nothing\u2019s happened; but to me, the\r\nskewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,\r\nTahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging\r\nslow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip\u2019s\r\nmissing. Let\u2019s see now if ye haven\u2019t fished him up here, fisherman.\r\nIt drags hard; I guess he\u2019s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off;\r\nwe haul in no cowards here. Ho! there\u2019s his arm just breaking water. A\r\nhatchet! a hatchet! cut it off\u2014we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab!\r\nsir, sir! here\u2019s Pip, trying to get on board again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cPeace, thou crazy loon,\u201d cried the Manxman, seizing him by the\r\narm. \u201cAway from the quarter-deck!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,\u201d muttered Ahab,\r\nadvancing. \u201cHands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was,\r\nboy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAstern there, sir, astern! Lo, lo!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of\r\nthy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve\r\nthrough! Who art thou, boy?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBell-boy, sir; ship\u2019s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One\r\nhundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high\u2014looks\r\ncowardly\u2014quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who\u2019s seen Pip\r\nthe coward?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look\r\ndown here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye\r\ncreative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab\u2019s cabin shall be Pip\u2019s home\r\nhenceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou art\r\ntied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let\u2019s down.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this? here\u2019s velvet shark-skin,\u201d intently\r\ngazing at Ahab\u2019s hand, and feeling it. \u201cAh, now, had poor Pip but\r\nfelt so kind a thing as this, perhaps he had ne\u2019er been lost! This seems\r\nto me, sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let\r\nold Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the\r\nwhite, for I will not let this go.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse\r\nhorrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in gods all\r\ngoodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods oblivious of\r\nsuffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not what he does, yet full\r\nof the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come! I feel prouder leading thee by\r\nthy black hand, than though I grasped an Emperor\u2019s!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere go two daft ones now,\u201d muttered the old Manxman. \u201cOne\r\ndaft with strength, the other daft with weakness. But here\u2019s the end of\r\nthe rotten line\u2014all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have\r\na new line altogether. I\u2019ll see Mr. Stubb about it.\u201dCHAPTER CXXVI.THE LIFE-BUOY\n\r\nSteering now south-eastward by Ahab\u2019s levelled steel, and her progress\r\nsolely determined by Ahab\u2019s level log and line; the Pequod held on her\r\npath towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such unfrequented\r\nwaters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade\r\nwinds, over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed the strange calm things\r\npreluding some riotous and desperate scene.\r\n\n\r\nAt last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\r\nEquatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn,\r\nwas sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch\u2014then headed by\r\nFlask\u2014was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly\u2014like\r\nhalf-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod\u2019s murdered\r\nInnocents\u2014that one and all, they started from their reveries, and for the\r\nspace of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all transfixedly listening, like\r\nthe carved Roman slave, while that wild cry remained within hearing. The\r\nChristian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered;\r\nbut the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman\u2014the\r\noldest mariner of all\u2014declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were\r\nheard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.\r\n\n\r\nBelow in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he came to\r\nthe deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not unaccompanied with hinted\r\ndark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus explained the wonder.\r\n\n\r\nThose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of\r\nseals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that had\r\nlost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her,\r\ncrying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the more\r\naffected some of them, because most mariners cherish a very superstitious\r\nfeeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar tones when in\r\ndistress, but also from the human look of their round heads and\r\nsemi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside. In\r\nthe sea, under certain circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken\r\nfor men.\r\n\n\r\nBut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\r\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At sun-rise this\r\nman went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether it was that\r\nhe was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors sometimes go aloft in a\r\ntransition state), whether it was thus with the man, there is now no telling;\r\nbut, be that as it may, he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was\r\nheard\u2014a cry and a rushing\u2014and looking up, they saw a falling\r\nphantom in the air; and looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in\r\nthe blue of the sea.\r\n\n\r\nThe life-buoy\u2014a long slender cask\u2014was dropped from the stern, where\r\nit always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it, and\r\nthe sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it slowly\r\nfilled, and the parched wood also filled at its every pore; and the studded\r\niron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his\r\npillow, though in sooth but a hard one.\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the\r\nWhite Whale, on the White Whale\u2019s own peculiar ground; that man was\r\nswallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time.\r\nIndeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a\r\nportent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future,\r\nbut as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They declared that now they\r\nknew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before. But\r\nagain the old Manxman said nay.\r\n\n\r\nThe lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to it;\r\nbut as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the feverish\r\neagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage, all hands were\r\nimpatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end,\r\nwhatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going to leave the\r\nship\u2019s stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and\r\ninuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cA life-buoy of a coffin!\u201d cried Starbuck, starting.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cRather queer, that, I should say,\u201d said Stubb.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIt will make a good enough one,\u201d said Flask, \u201cthe carpenter\r\nhere can arrange it easily.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBring it up; there\u2019s nothing else for it,\u201d said Starbuck,\r\nafter a melancholy pause. \u201cRig it, carpenter; do not look at me\r\nso\u2014the coffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd shall I nail down the lid, sir?\u201d moving his hand as with a\r\nhammer.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd shall I caulk the seams, sir?\u201d moving his hand as with a\r\ncaulking-iron.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?\u201d moving his\r\nhand as with a pitch-pot.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAway! What possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and\r\nno more.\u2014Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks.\r\nNow I don\u2019t like this. I make a leg for captain Ahab, and he wears it\r\nlike a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he wont put his head\r\ninto it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I\u2019m\r\nordered to make a life-buoy of it. It\u2019s like turning an old coat; going\r\nto bring the flesh on the other side now. I don\u2019t like this cobbling sort\r\nof business\u2014I don\u2019t like it at all; it\u2019s undignified;\r\nit\u2019s not my place. Let tinkers\u2019 brats do tinkerings; we are their\r\nbetters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square\r\nmathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at\r\nthe middle when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a\r\ncobbler\u2019s job, that\u2019s at an end in the middle, and at the beginning\r\nat the end. It\u2019s the old woman\u2019s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.\r\nLord! what an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of\r\nsixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that\u2019s\r\nthe reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my\r\njob-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads\r\nto run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let\r\nme see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch;\r\nbatten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship\u2019s\r\nstern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old\r\ncarpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job.\r\nBut I\u2019m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don\u2019t budge. Cruppered\r\nwith a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers\r\nin woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses.\r\nWe work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the\r\nwhy and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then\r\nwe stash it if we can. Hem! I\u2019ll do the job, now, tenderly. I\u2019ll\r\nhave me\u2014let\u2019s see\u2014how many in the ship\u2019s company, all\r\ntold? But I\u2019ve forgotten. Any way, I\u2019ll have me thirty separate,\r\nTurk\u2019s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the\r\ncoffin. Then, if the hull go down, there\u2019ll be thirty lively fellows all\r\nfighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun! Come\r\nhammer, calking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let\u2019s to it.\u201dCHAPTER CXXVII.THE DECK\n\nThe coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the open\r\nhatchway; the Carpenter calking its seams; the string of twisted oakum slowly\r\nunwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frock.\u2014Ahab\r\ncomes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip following him.\n\n\r\n\u201cBack, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand\r\ncomplies with my humor more genially than that boy.\u2014Middle aisle of a\r\nchurch! What\u2019s here?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLife buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck\u2019s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the\r\nhatchway!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cArt not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy\r\nshop?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWell enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but\r\nthey\u2019ve set me now to turning it into something else.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, inter-meddling,\r\nmonopolizing, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the next day\r\ncoffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins?\r\nThou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a\r\njack-of-all-trades.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin?\r\nThe Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for\r\nvolcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost thou\r\nnever?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I\u2019m indifferent enough, sir, for that;\r\nbut the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was\r\nnone in his spade, sir. But the calking mallet is full of it. Hark to\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, and that\u2019s because the lid there\u2019s a sounding-board;\r\nand what in all things makes the sounding-board is this\u2014there\u2019s\r\nnaught beneath. And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same,\r\nCarpenter. Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock\r\nagainst the churchyard gate, going in?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFaith, sir, I\u2019ve\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFaith? What\u2019s that?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy, faith, sir, it\u2019s only a sort of\r\nexclamation-like\u2014that\u2019s all, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUm, um; go on.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI was about to say, sir, that\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cArt thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself? Look\r\nat thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot\r\nlatitudes. I\u2019ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the Gallipagos,\r\nis cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some sort of Equator\r\ncuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He\u2019s always under the\r\nLine\u2014fiery hot, I tell ye! He\u2019s looking this way\u2014come, oakum;\r\nquick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I\u2019m the\r\nprofessor of musical glasses\u2014tap, tap!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n(Ahab to himself.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sight! There\u2019s sound! The greyheaded woodpecker\r\ntapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that\r\nthing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag, that\r\nfellow. Rat-tat! So man\u2019s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all\r\nmaterials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here\r\nnow\u2019s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the\r\nexpressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A life-buoy of a\r\ncoffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin\r\nis, after all, but an immortality-preserver! I\u2019ll think of that. But no.\r\nSo far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the theoretic\r\nbright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will ye never have done,\r\nCarpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here\r\nwhen I return again. Now, then, Pip, we\u2019ll talk this over; I do suck most\r\nwondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds\r\nmust empty into thee!\u201dCHAPTER CXXVIII.THE PEQUOD MEETS THE RACHEL\n\r\nNext day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down upon\r\nthe Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time the Pequod\r\nwas making good speed through the water; but as the broad-winged windward\r\nstranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all fell together as blank\r\nbladders that are burst, and all life fled from the smitten hull.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBad news; she brings bad news,\u201d muttered the old Manxman. But ere\r\nher commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could\r\nhopefully hail, Ahab\u2019s voice was heard.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThrottling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and\r\nwould then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain himself,\r\nhaving stopped his vessel\u2019s way, was seen descending her side. A few keen\r\npulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod\u2019s main-chains, and he\r\nsprang to the deck. Immediately he was recognized by Ahab for a Nantucketer he\r\nknew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhere was he?\u2014not killed!\u2014not killed!\u201d cried Ahab,\r\nclosely advancing. \u201cHow was it?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while three\r\nof the stranger\u2019s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which had\r\nled them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were yet in\r\nswift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly\r\nloomed up out of the blue water, not very far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth\r\nrigged boat\u2014a reserved one\u2014had been instantly lowered in chase.\r\nAfter a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat\u2014the swiftest keeled\r\nof all\u2014seemed to have succeeded in fastening\u2014at least, as well as\r\nthe man at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the distance he saw\r\nthe diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and\r\nafter that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must\r\nhave indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was some\r\napprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in\r\nthe rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward\r\nboats\u2014ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite\r\ndirection\u2014the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to\r\nits fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from\r\nit. But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all\r\nsail\u2014stunsail on stunsail\u2014after the missing boat; kindling a fire\r\nin her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But\r\nthough when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed\r\nplace of the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her\r\nspare boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed\r\non; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued\r\ndoing till day light; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been\r\nseen.\r\n\n\r\nThe story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object\r\nin boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his own in the\r\nsearch; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on parallel\r\nlines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will wager something now,\u201d whispered Stubb to Flask, \u201cthat\r\nsome one in that missing boat wore off that Captain\u2019s best coat; mayhap,\r\nhis watch\u2014he\u2019s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of\r\ntwo pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height of\r\nthe whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks\u2014pale in the\r\nvery buttons of his eyes\u2014look\u2014it wasn\u2019t the coat\u2014it\r\nmust have been the\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy boy, my own boy is among them. For God\u2019s sake\u2014I beg, I\r\nconjure\u201d\u2014here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far\r\nhad but icily received his petition. \u201cFor eight-and-forty hours let me\r\ncharter your ship\u2014I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for\r\nit\u2014if there be no other way\u2014for eight-and-forty hours\r\nonly\u2014only that\u2014you must, oh, you must, and you shall do this\r\nthing.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHis son!\u201d cried Stubb, \u201coh, it\u2019s his son he\u2019s\r\nlost! I take back the coat and watch\u2014what says Ahab? We must save that\r\nboy.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s drowned with the rest on \u2019em, last night,\u201d said\r\nthe old Manx sailor standing behind them; \u201cI heard; all of ye heard their\r\nspirits.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nNow, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel\u2019s\r\nthe more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the\r\nCaptain\u2019s sons among the number of the missing boat\u2019s crew; but\r\namong the number of the other boat\u2019s crews, at the same time, but on the\r\nother hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase,\r\nthere had been still another son; as that for a time, the wretched father was\r\nplunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity; which was only solved for\r\nhim by his chief mate\u2019s instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of\r\na whale-ship in such emergencies, that is, when placed between jeopardized but\r\ndivided boats, always to pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some\r\nunknown constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not\r\ntill forced to it by Ahab\u2019s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing\r\nboy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest but\r\nunmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer\u2019s paternal love, had thus early\r\nsought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost\r\nimmemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it unfrequently occur, that\r\nNantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them, for a\r\nprotracted three or four years\u2019 voyage in some other ship than their own;\r\nso that their first knowledge of a whaleman\u2019s career shall be unenervated\r\nby any chance display of a father\u2019s natural but untimely partiality, or\r\nundue apprehensiveness and concern.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab; and Ahab\r\nstill stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without the least\r\nquivering of his own.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will not go,\u201d said the stranger, \u201ctill you say aye\r\nto me. Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case. For you\r\ntoo have a boy, Captain Ahab\u2014though but a child, and nestling safely at\r\nhome now\u2014a child of your old age too\u2014Yes, yes, you relent; I see\r\nit\u2014run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAvast,\u201d cried Ahab\u2014\u201ctouch not a rope-yarn;\u201d then\r\nin a voice that prolongingly moulded every word\u2014\u201cCaptain Gardiner,\r\nI will not do it. Even now I lose time. Good bye, good bye. God bless ye, man,\r\nand may I forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle\r\nwatch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers:\r\nthen brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin, leaving the\r\nstrange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so\r\nearnest suit. But starting from his enchantment, Gardiner silently hurried to\r\nthe side; more fell than stepped into his boat, and returned to his ship.\r\n\n\r\nSoon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel was in\r\nview, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot, however small,\r\non the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round; starboard and\r\nlarboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head sea; and again it\r\npushed her before it; while all the while, her masts and yards were thickly\r\nclustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying\r\namong the boughs.\r\n\n\r\nBut by her still halting course and winding, woful way, you plainly saw that\r\nthis ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort. She was\r\nRachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.CHAPTER CXXIX.THE CABIN\n\r\n(Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is coming\r\nwhen Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee by him. There\r\nis that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my malady. Like cures\r\nlike; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired health. Do thou\r\nabide below here, where they shall serve thee, as if thou wert the captain.\r\nAye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it,\r\nthou must be.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for\r\nyour one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain a part\r\nof ye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless\r\nfidelity of man!\u2014and a black! and crazy!\u2014but methinks\r\nlike-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose\r\ndrowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin. But I\r\nwill never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with ye.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIf thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab\u2019s purpose keels up in\r\nhim. I tell thee no; it cannot be.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh good master, master, master!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWeep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.\r\nListen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still know\r\nthat I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!\u2014Met! True art thou, lad,\r\nas the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless thee; and if it come\r\nto that,\u2014God for ever save thee, let what will befall.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n(Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.)\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHere he this instant stood; I stand in his air,\u2014but I\u2019m\r\nalone. Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he\u2019s missing.\r\nPip! Pip! Ding, dong, ding! Who\u2019s seen Pip? He must be up here;\r\nlet\u2019s try the door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet\r\nthere\u2019s no opening it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here:\r\nAye, and told me this screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I\u2019ll seat me,\r\nagainst the transom, in the ship\u2019s full middle, all her keel and her\r\nthree masts before me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours\r\ngreat admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and\r\nlieutenants. Ha! what\u2019s this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all come\r\ncrowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs! What an\r\nodd feeling, now, when a black boy\u2019s host to white men with gold lace\r\nupon their coats!\u2014Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?\u2014a little negro\r\nlad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat\r\nonce;\u2014seen him? No! Well then, fill up again, captains, and let\u2019s\r\ndrink shame upon all cowards! I name no names. Shame upon them! Put one foot\r\nupon the table. Shame upon all cowards.\u2014Hist! above there, I hear\r\nivory\u2014Oh, master, master! I am indeed down-hearted when you walk over me.\r\nBut here I\u2019ll stay, though this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge\r\nthrough; and oysters come to join me.\u201dCHAPTER CXXX.THE HAT\n\r\nAnd now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a preliminary\r\ncruise, Ahab,\u2014all other whaling waters swept\u2014seemed to have chased\r\nhis foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there; now, that he\r\nfound himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting\r\nwound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very\r\nday preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;\u2014and now that all his\r\nsuccessive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the\r\ndemoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether\r\nsinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something in the old\r\nman\u2019s eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As\r\nthe unsetting polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months\u2019\r\nnight sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab\u2019s purpose now\r\nfixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It\r\ndomineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears,\r\nwere fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or\r\nleaf.\r\n\n\r\nIn this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural, vanished.\r\nStubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove to check one.\r\nAlike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and\r\npowdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab\u2019s iron soul. Like\r\nmachines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious that the old\r\nman\u2019s despot eye was on them.\r\n\n\r\nBut did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when he\r\nthought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even as\r\nAhab\u2019s eyes so awed the crew\u2019s, the inscrutable Parsee\u2019s\r\nglance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.\r\nSuch an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such\r\nceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half\r\nuncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a\r\ntremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being\u2019s body. And that\r\nshadow was always hovering there. For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever\r\ncertainly been known to slumber, or go below. He would stand still for hours:\r\nbut never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say\u2014We two\r\nwatchmen never rest.\r\n\n\r\nNor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step up the deck,\r\nunless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or exactly\r\npacing the planks between two undeviating limits,\u2014the main-mast and the\r\nmizen; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,\u2014his living\r\nfoot advanced upon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched heavily over his\r\neyes; so that however motionless he stood, however the days and nights were\r\nadded on, that he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that\r\nslouching hat, they could never tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes\r\nwere really closed at times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no\r\nmatter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and\r\nthe unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat\r\nand hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day\u2019s sunshine\r\ndried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more\r\nbeneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.\r\n\n\r\nHe ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,\u2014breakfast and\r\ndinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all\r\ngnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at\r\nnaked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though his whole life was\r\nnow become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee\u2019s mystic watch was\r\nwithout intermission as his own; yet these two never seemed to speak\u2014one\r\nman to the other\u2014unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter\r\nmade it necessary. Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the\r\ntwain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by\r\nday they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as\r\nconcerned the slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours,\r\nwithout a single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his\r\nscuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other;\r\nas if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his\r\nabandoned substance.\r\n\n\r\nAnd yet, somehow, did Ahab\u2014in his own proper self, as daily, hourly, and\r\nevery instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,\u2014Ahab seemed an\r\nindependent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both seemed yoked\r\ntogether, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid\r\nrib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab.\r\n\n\r\nAt the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard from\r\naft\u2014\u201cMan the mast-heads!\u201d\u2014and all through the day, till\r\nafter sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking of\r\nthe helmsman\u2019s bell, was heard\u2014\u201cWhat d\u2019ye\r\nsee?\u2014sharp! sharp!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the children-seeking\r\nRachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac old man seemed\r\ndistrustful of his crew\u2019s fidelity; at least, of nearly all except the\r\nPagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not\r\nwillingly overlook the sight he sought. But if these suspicions were really\r\nhis, he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his\r\nactions might seem to hint them.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI will have the first sight of the whale myself,\u201d\u2014he said.\r\n\u201cAye! Ahab must have the doubloon!\u201d and with his own hands he\r\nrigged a nest of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single\r\nsheaved block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the\r\ndownward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the\r\nother end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that end yet in\r\nhis hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping\r\nfrom one to the other; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego;\r\nbut shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief\r\nmate, said,\u2014\u201cTake the rope, sir\u2014I give it into thy hands,\r\nStarbuck.\u201d Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for\r\nthem to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at\r\nlast; and afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the\r\nroyal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,\u2014ahead,\r\nastern, this side, and that,\u2014within the wide expanded circle commanded at\r\nso great a height.\r\n\n\r\nWhen in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the\r\nrigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up\r\nto that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these circumstances, its\r\nfastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has\r\nthe special watch of it. Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose\r\nvarious different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what\r\nis seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being\r\nevery few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural\r\nfatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by\r\nsome carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.\r\nSo Ahab\u2019s proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange\r\nthing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who had\r\never ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching\r\nto decision\u2014one of those too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had\r\nseemed to doubt somewhat;\u2014it was strange, that this was the very man he\r\nshould select for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an\r\notherwise distrusted person\u2019s hands.\r\n\n\r\nNow, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten minutes;\r\none of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously\r\nclose round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes; one of these\r\nbirds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift\r\ncirclings. Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air; then\r\nspiralized downwards, and went eddying again round his head.\r\n\n\r\nBut with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not to\r\nmark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked it much, it\r\nbeing no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to\r\nsee some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cYour hat, your hat, sir!\u201d suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who\r\nbeing posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though\r\nsomewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.\r\n\n\r\nBut already the sable wing was before the old man\u2019s eyes; the long hooked\r\nbill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his prize.\r\n\n\r\nAn eagle flew thrice round Tarquin\u2019s head, removing his cap to replace\r\nit, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of\r\nRome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good.\r\nAhab\u2019s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far\r\nin advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of that\r\ndisappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast\r\nheight into the sea.CHAPTER CXXXI.THE PEQUOD MEETS THE DELIGHT\n\r\nThe intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\r\nlife-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably misnamed\r\nthe Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad\r\nbeams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at\r\nthe height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or\r\ndisabled boats.\r\n\n\r\nUpon the stranger\u2019s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and\r\nsome few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw\r\nthrough this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged,\r\nand bleaching skeleton of a horse.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLook!\u201d replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and\r\nwith his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHast killed him?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe harpoon is not yet forged that will ever do that,\u201d answered\r\nthe other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered\r\nsides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot forged!\u201d and snatching Perth\u2019s levelled iron from the\r\ncrotch, Ahab held it out, exclaiming\u2014\u201cLook ye, Nantucketer; here in\r\nthis hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are\r\nthese barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the\r\nfin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThen God keep thee, old man\u2014see\u2019st thou\r\nthat\u201d\u2014pointing to the hammock\u2014\u201cI bury but one of five\r\nstout men, who were alive only yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only\r\nthat one I bury; the rest were buried before they died; you sail upon\r\ntheir tomb.\u201d Then turning to his crew\u2014\u201cAre ye ready there?\r\nplace the plank then on the rail, and lift the body; so, then\u2014Oh!\r\nGod\u201d\u2014advancing towards the hammock with uplifted\r\nhands\u2014\u201cmay the resurrection and the life\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBrace forward! Up helm!\u201d cried Ahab like lightning to his men.\r\n\n\r\nBut the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the\r\nsplash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so quick, indeed,\r\nbut that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their\r\nghostly baptism.\r\n\n\r\nAs Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy hanging at\r\nthe Pequod\u2019s stern came into conspicuous relief.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHa! yonder! look yonder, men!\u201d cried a foreboding voice in her\r\nwake. \u201cIn vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us\r\nyour taffrail to show us your coffin!\u201dCHAPTER CXXXII.THE SYMPHONY\n\r\nIt was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly\r\nseparable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was transparently\r\npure and soft, with a woman\u2019s look, and the robust and man-like sea\r\nheaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson\u2019s chest in his\r\nsleep.\r\n\n\r\nHither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small, unspeckled\r\nbirds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but to and fro in\r\nthe deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans,\r\nsword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled, murderous\r\nthinkings of the masculine sea.\r\n\n\r\nBut though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and shadows\r\nwithout; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were, that\r\ndistinguished them.\r\n\n\r\nAloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air to\r\nthis bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling line of\r\nthe horizon, a soft and tremulous motion\u2014most seen here at the\r\nequator\u2014denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which\r\nthe poor bride gave her bosom away.\r\n\n\r\nTied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and\r\nunyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of ruin;\r\nuntottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his\r\nsplintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl\u2019s forehead of heaven.\r\n\n\r\nOh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged creatures\r\nthat frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how oblivious were ye\r\nof old Ahab\u2019s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen little Miriam and\r\nMartha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting\r\nwith the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt-out\r\ncrater of his brain.\r\n\n\r\nSlowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side, and\r\nwatched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more and the\r\nmore that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely aromas in that\r\nenchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in\r\nhis soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress\r\nhim; the step-mother world, so long cruel\u2014forbidding\u2014now threw\r\naffectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over\r\nhim, as if over one, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in\r\nher heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a\r\ntear into the sea; nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee\r\ndrop.\r\n\n\r\nStarbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side; and he\r\nseemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of\r\nthe centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by\r\nhim, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.\r\n\n\r\nAhab turned.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStarbuck!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such a\r\nday\u2014very much such a sweetness as this\u2014I struck my first\r\nwhale\u2014a boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty\u2014forty\u2014forty years\r\nago!\u2014ago! Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and\r\nperil, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has\r\nAhab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of\r\nthe deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent\r\nthree ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the desolation of solitude\r\nit has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain\u2019s exclusiveness, which\r\nadmits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country\r\nwithout\u2014oh, weariness! heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of solitary\r\ncommand!\u2014when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so keenly\r\nknown to me before\u2014and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted\r\nfare\u2014fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soul\u2014when the poorest\r\nlandsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the world\u2019s\r\nfresh bread to my mouldy crusts\u2014away, whole oceans away, from that young\r\ngirl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving\r\nbut one dent in my marriage pillow\u2014wife? wife?\u2014rather a widow with\r\nher husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck;\r\nand then, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with\r\nwhich, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly chased his\r\nprey\u2014more a demon than a man!\u2014aye, aye! what a forty years\u2019\r\nfool\u2014fool\u2014old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the\r\nchase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?\r\nhow the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard,\r\nthat with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from\r\nunder me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to weep.\r\nLocks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old,\r\nso very, very old, Starbuck? I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though\r\nI were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God!\r\nGod!\u2014crack my heart!\u2014stave my brain!\u2014mockery! mockery!\r\nbitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and\r\nseem and feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me\r\nlook into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than\r\nto gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the\r\nmagic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on\r\nboard, on board!\u2014lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to\r\nMoby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the far away home I\r\nsee in that eye!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why\r\nshould any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us fly these\r\ndeadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are\r\nStarbuck\u2019s\u2014wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow\r\nyouth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving, longing,\r\npaternal old age! Away! let us away!\u2014this instant let me alter the\r\ncourse! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way\r\nto see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days,\r\neven as this, in Nantucket.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey have, they have. I have seen them\u2014some summer days in the\r\nmorning. About this time\u2014yes, it is his noon nap now\u2014the boy\r\nvivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of cannibal\r\nold me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to dance him\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning,\r\nshould be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father\u2019s\r\nsail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my Captain,\r\nstudy out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy\u2019s face from the\r\nwindow! the boy\u2019s hand on the hill!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut Ahab\u2019s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and\r\ncast his last, cindered apple to the soil.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what\r\ncozzening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me;\r\nthat against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding,\r\nand jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my\r\nown proper, natural heart, I durst not so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I,\r\nGod, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but\r\nis as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some\r\ninvisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain\r\nthink thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that\r\nliving, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this world,\r\nlike yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that\r\nsmiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it into\r\nhim to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who\u2019s\r\nto doom, when the judge himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild\r\nwind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from a\r\nfar-away meadow; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the\r\nAndes, Starbuck, and the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping?\r\nAye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and\r\nrust amid greenness; as last year\u2019s scythes flung down, and left in the\r\nhalf-cut swaths\u2014Starbuck!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut blanched to a corpse\u2019s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.\r\n\n\r\nAhab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two\r\nreflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly leaning\r\nover the same rail.CHAPTER CXXXIII.THE CHASE\u2014FIRST DAY\n\r\nThat night, in the mid-watch, when the old man\u2014as his wont at\r\nintervals\u2014stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went to\r\nhis pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing up the sea\r\nair as a sagacious ship\u2019s dog will, in drawing nigh to some barbarous\r\nisle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes\r\nto a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale, was palpable to all\r\nthe watch; nor was any mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass,\r\nand then the dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as\r\nnearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship\u2019s course to be slightly\r\naltered, and the sail to be shortened.\r\n\n\r\nThe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at\r\ndaybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise\r\nahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering\r\nit, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a\r\ndeep, rapid stream.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMan the mast-heads! Call all hands!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck,\r\nDaggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale\r\nfrom the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat d\u2019ye see?\u201d cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing, nothing, sir!\u201d was the sound hailing down in reply.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cT\u2019gallant sails!\u2014stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both\r\nsides!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAll sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying him\r\nto the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting him\r\nthither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead\r\nthrough the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail,\r\nhe raised a gull-like cry in the air, \u201cThere she blows!\u2014there she\r\nblows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs,\r\nthe men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so\r\nlong been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet above the\r\nother look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the\r\ntop-gallant mast, so that the Indian\u2019s head was almost on a level with\r\nAhab\u2019s heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so\r\nahead, at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump, and\r\nregularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To the credulous mariners it\r\nseemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit\r\nAtlantic and Indian Oceans.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd did none of ye see it before?\u201d cried Ahab, hailing the perched\r\nmen all around him.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\r\ncried out,\u201d said Tashtego.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNot the same instant; not the same\u2014no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\r\nreserved the doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the\r\nWhite Whale first. There she blows! there she blows!\u2014there she blows!\r\nThere again!\u2014there again!\u201d he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,\r\nmethodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale\u2019s visible\r\njets. \u201cHe\u2019s going to sound! In stunsails! Down top-gallant-sails!\r\nStand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship.\r\nHelm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No,\r\nno; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me,\r\nMr. Starbuck; lower, lower,\u2014quick, quicker!\u201d and he slid through\r\nthe air to the deck.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHe is heading straight to leeward, sir,\u201d cried Stubb, \u201cright\r\naway from us; cannot have seen the ship yet.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBe dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!\u2014brace up!\r\nShiver her!\u2014shiver her! So; well that! Boats, boats!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSoon all the boats but Starbuck\u2019s were dropped; all the boat-sails\r\nset\u2014all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward;\r\nand Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah\u2019s\r\nsunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\r\n\n\r\nLike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea; but\r\nonly slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew still more\r\nsmooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so\r\nserenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly\r\nunsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible,\r\nsliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a\r\nrevolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved\r\nwrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft\r\nTurkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\r\nforehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the\r\nblue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady\r\nwake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these\r\nwere broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering\r\nthe sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising\r\nfrom the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent\r\nlance projected from the white whale\u2019s back; and at intervals one of the\r\ncloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\r\nthe fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers\r\nstreaming like pennons.\r\n\n\r\nA gentle joyousness\u2014a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\r\nthe gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished\r\nEuropa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes sideways intent\r\nupon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling straight for the\r\nnuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass\r\nthe glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.\r\n\n\r\nOn each soft side\u2014coincident with the parted swell, that but once leaving\r\nhim, then flowed so wide away\u2014on each bright side, the whale shed off\r\nenticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly\r\ntransported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured to assail it; but\r\nhad fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes. Yet calm,\r\nenticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who for the first time eye\r\nthee, no matter how many in that same way thou may\u2019st have bejuggled and\r\ndestroyed before.\r\n\n\r\nAnd thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among waves\r\nwhose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved on,\r\nstill withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk, entirely\r\nhiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore part of him\r\nslowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a\r\nhigh arch, like Virginia\u2019s Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his\r\nbannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went\r\nout of sight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\r\nlongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\r\n\n\r\nWith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the three\r\nboats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick\u2019s reappearance.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAn hour,\u201d said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat\u2019s stern;\r\nand he gazed beyond the whale\u2019s place, towards the dim blue spaces and\r\nwide wooing vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes\r\nseemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now\r\nfreshened; the sea began to swell.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe birds!\u2014the birds!\u201d cried Tashtego.\r\n\n\r\nIn long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now all\r\nflying towards Ahab\u2019s boat; and when within a few yards began fluttering\r\nover the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous, expectant cries.\r\nTheir vision was keener than man\u2019s; Ahab could discover no sign in the\r\nsea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw\r\na white living spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity\r\nuprising, and magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were\r\nplainly revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up\r\nfrom the undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick\u2019s open mouth and\r\nscrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the\r\nsea. The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\r\ntomb; and giving one side-long sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the\r\ncraft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to\r\nchange places with him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth\u2019s\r\nharpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\r\n\n\r\nNow, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its bow,\r\nby anticipation, was made to face the whale\u2019s head while yet under water.\r\nBut as if perceiving this strategem, Moby Dick, with that malicious\r\nintelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in\r\nan instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.\r\n\n\r\nThrough and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an\r\ninstant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting\r\nshark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the\r\nlong, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of\r\nthe teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw\r\nwas within six inches of Ahab\u2019s head, and reached higher than that. In\r\nthis attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat\r\nher mouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\r\ntiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other\u2019s heads to gain the\r\nuttermost stern.\r\n\n\r\nAnd now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the whale\r\ndallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his body being\r\nsubmerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the bows, for the\r\nbows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats\r\ninvoluntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it\r\nwas that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe,\r\nwhich placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied\r\nwith all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove\r\nto wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from\r\nhim; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\r\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and\r\nlocked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two floating\r\nwrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the\r\nstern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to\r\nlash them across.\r\n\n\r\nAt that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to\r\nperceive the whale\u2019s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\r\nmovement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had made\r\none final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping further\r\ninto the whale\u2019s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped, the boat\r\nhad shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the\r\npush; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.\r\n\n\r\nRipplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little distance,\r\nvertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows; and at\r\nthe same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so that when his vast\r\nwrinkled forehead rose\u2014some twenty or more feet out of the\r\nwater\u2014the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves, dazzlingly\r\nbroke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into\r\nthe air.[23] So,\r\nin a gale, the but half-baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of\r\nthe Eddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\r\n\n  [23] This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It\r\nreceives its designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that\r\npreliminary up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\r\npitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best and most\r\ncomprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.\r\n\n\r\nBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round and\r\nround the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake, as if\r\nlashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault. The sight of the\r\nsplintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries\r\ncast before Antiochus\u2019s elephants in the book of Maccabees. Meanwhile\r\nAhab half smothered in the foam of the whale\u2019s insolent tail, and too\r\nmuch of a cripple to swim,\u2014though he could still keep afloat, even in the\r\nheart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab\u2019s head was seen, like a\r\ntossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst. From the boat\u2019s\r\nfragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew,\r\nat the other drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for\r\nthem to look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White\r\nWhale\u2019s aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he\r\nmade, that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\r\nboats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy\r\nto strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the\r\njeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves\r\nhope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of\r\nthe direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man\u2019s head.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship\u2019s\r\nmast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and was\r\nnow so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her;\u2014Sail on the\u2014but\r\nthat moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for\r\nthe time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a towering\r\ncrest, he shouted,\u2014\u201cSail on the whale!\u2014Drive him off!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe Pequod\u2019s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she\r\neffectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam off,\r\nthe boats flew to the rescue.\r\n\n\r\nDragged into Stubb\u2019s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine\r\ncaking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab\u2019s bodily strength did\r\ncrack, and helplessly he yielded to his body\u2019s doom: for a time, lying\r\nall crushed in the bottom of Stubb\u2019s boat, like one trodden under foot of\r\nherds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate\r\nsounds from out ravines.\r\n\n\r\nBut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\r\nabbreviate it. In an instant\u2019s compass, great hearts sometimes condense\r\nto one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through\r\nfeebler men\u2019s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary in each\r\none suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time aggregate a\r\nwhole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in\r\ntheir pointless centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences\r\nof inferior souls.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe harpoon,\u201d said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning\r\non one bended arm\u2014\u201cis it safe?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\u201d said Stubb, showing\r\nit.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLay it before me;\u2014any missing men?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOne, two, three, four, five;\u2014there were five oars, sir, and here\r\nare five men.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u2014Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see\r\nhim! there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout! Hands off from\r\nme! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab\u2019s bones again! Set the sail; out\r\noars; the helm!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up by\r\nanother boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus continued\r\nwith what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the added power of\r\nthe boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have\r\ntreble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed,\r\nthat if now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an\r\nindefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so\r\nlong a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\r\nbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as\r\nit sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of\r\novertaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon\r\nswayed up to their cranes\u2014the two parts of the wrecked boat having been\r\npreviously secured by her\u2014and then hoisting everything to her side, and\r\nstacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with stun-sails,\r\nlike the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod bore down in the\r\nleeward wake of Moby Dick. At the well known, methodic intervals, the\r\nwhale\u2019s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned\r\nmast-heads; and when he would be reported as just gone down, Ahab would take\r\nthe time, and then pacing the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last\r\nsecond of the allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.\u2014\u201cWhose is\r\nthe doubloon now? D\u2019ye see him?\u201d and if the reply was, No, sir!\r\nstraightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day\r\nwore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.\r\n\n\r\nAs he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft, or to\r\nbid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still greater\r\nbreadth\u2014thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at every turn\r\nhe passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck,\r\nand lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern. At last he paused before\r\nit; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes\r\nsail across, so over the old man\u2019s face there now stole some such added\r\ngloom as this.\r\n\n\r\nStubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to evince his\r\nown unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain\u2019s\r\nmind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed\u2014\u201cThe thistle the\r\nass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did I\r\nnot know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear thou\r\nwert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, sir,\u201d said Starbuck drawing near, \u201c\u2019tis a solemn\r\nsight; an omen, and an ill one.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOmen? omen?\u2014the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to\r\nman, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and give an old\r\nwives\u2019 darkling hint.\u2014Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles of one\r\nthing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye two are all\r\nmankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth, nor\r\ngods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold\u2014I shiver!\u2014How now? Aloft\r\nthere! D\u2019ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he spout ten times\r\na second!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling. Soon, it\r\nwas almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t see the spout now, sir;\u2014too dark\u201d\u2014cried a\r\nvoice from the air.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHow heading when last seen?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs before, sir,\u2014straight to leeward.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGood! he will travel slower now \u2019tis night. Down royals and\r\ntop-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning;\r\nhe\u2019s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her\r\nfull before the wind!\u2014Aloft! come down!\u2014Mr. Stubb, send a fresh\r\nhand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till morning.\u2014Then\r\nadvancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast\u2014Men, this gold is mine,\r\nfor I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead;\r\nand then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day he shall be killed,\r\nthis gold is that man\u2019s; and if on that day I shall again raise him,\r\nthen, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away now!\u2014the\r\ndeck is thine, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and slouching his\r\nhat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals rousing himself to see how\r\nthe night wore on.CHAPTER CXXXIV.THE CHASE\u2014SECOND DAY\n\r\nAt day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cD\u2019ye see him?\u201d cried Ahab, after allowing a little space for\r\nthe light to spread.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSee nothing, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTurn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought\r\nfor;\u2014the top-gallant sails!\u2014aye, they should have been kept on her\r\nall night. But no matter\u2014\u2019tis but resting for the rush.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHere be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,\r\ncontinued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing by no\r\nmeans unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the wonderful skill,\r\nprescience of experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great\r\nnatural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple\r\nobservation of a whale when last descried, they will, under certain given\r\ncircumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will\r\ncontinue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate\r\nof progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot,\r\nwhen about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and\r\nwhich he desires shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as\r\nthis pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at\r\npresent visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen\r\nheadland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with\r\nthe whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours\r\nof daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature\u2019s future\r\nwake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the\r\nhunter, as the pilot\u2019s coast is to him. So that to this hunter\u2019s\r\nwondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is\r\nto all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the\r\nmighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every\r\npace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a\r\nbaby\u2019s pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or the down train will\r\nreach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are\r\noccasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\r\naccording to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many\r\nhours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about\r\nreached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this\r\nacuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the\r\nwhaleman\u2019s allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound\r\nmariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a\r\nquarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many collateral\r\nsubtile matters touching the chase of whales.\r\n\n\r\nThe ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball,\r\nmissent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBy salt and hemp!\u201d cried Stubb, \u201cbut this swift motion of\r\nthe deck creeps up one\u2019s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I\r\nare two brave fellows!\u2014Ha! ha! Some one take me up, and launch me,\r\nspine-wise, on the sea,\u2014for by live-oaks! my spine\u2019s a keel. Ha,\r\nha! we go the gait that leaves no dust behind!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere she blows\u2014she blows!\u2014she blows!\u2014right\r\nahead!\u201d was now the mast-head cry.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye!\u201d cried Stubb. \u201cI knew it\u2014ye can\u2019t\r\nescape\u2014blow on and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is\r\nafter ye! blow your trump\u2014blister your lungs!\u2014Ahab will dam off\r\nyour blood, as a miller shuts his water-gate upon the stream!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAnd Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of the\r\nchase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked anew.\r\nWhatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before; these\r\nwere not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they\r\nwere broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter\r\nbefore the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and\r\nby the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past night\u2019s\r\nsuspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft\r\nwent plunging towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were\r\nbowled along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\r\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that\r\nunseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\r\n\n\r\nThey were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all; though\r\nit was put together of all contrasting things\u2014oak, and maple, and pine\r\nwood; iron, and pitch, and hemp\u2014yet all these ran into each other in the\r\none concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the\r\nlong central keel; even so, all the individualities of the crew, this\r\nman\u2019s valor, that man\u2019s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all varieties\r\nwere welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab\r\ntheir one lord and keel did point to.\r\n\n\r\nThe rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\r\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one hand,\r\nsome reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading their eyes\r\nfrom the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all the spars in\r\nfull bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah! how they still\r\nstrove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy\r\nthem!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhy sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\u201d cried Ahab, when,\r\nafter the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.\r\n\u201cSway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet\r\nthat way, and then disappears.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIt was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some other\r\nthing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for hardly had Ahab\r\nreached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck, when he\r\nstruck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the\r\ncombined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs\r\nwas heard, as\u2014much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary\r\njet, less than a mile ahead\u2014Moby Dick bodily burst into view! For not by\r\nany calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic\r\nfountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the\r\nfar more wondrous phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from\r\nthe furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure\r\nelement of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to\r\nthe distance of seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves\r\nhe shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of\r\ndefiance.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThere she breaches! there she breaches!\u201d was the cry, as in his\r\nimmeasureable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to Heaven.\r\nSo suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved against the still\r\nbluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for the moment, intolerably\r\nglittered and glared like a glacier; and stood there gradually fading and\r\nfading away from its first sparkling intensity, to the dim mistiness of an\r\nadvancing shower in a vale.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, breach your last to the sun,\u201d Moby Dick! cried Ahab,\r\n\u201cthy hour and thy harpoon are at hand!\u2014Down! down all of ye, but\r\none man at the fore. The boats!\u2014stand by!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nUnmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like shooting\r\nstars, slid to the deck, by the isolated back-stays and halyards; while Ahab,\r\nless dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLower away,\u201d he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat\u2014a\r\nspare one, rigged the afternoon previous. \u201cMr. Starbuck, the ship is\r\nthine\u2014keep away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nAs if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\r\nassailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three\r\ncrews. Ahab\u2019s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he\r\nwould take the whale head-and-head,\u2014that is, pull straight up to his\r\nforehead,\u2014a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such a\r\ncourse excludes the coming onset from the whale\u2019s sidelong vision. But\r\nere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were plain as\r\nthe ship\u2019s three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning himself into\r\nfurious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with\r\nopen jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and\r\nheedless of the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent on\r\nannihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made. But skilfully\r\nman\u0153uvred, incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats\r\nfor a while eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank\u2019s breadth; while\r\nall the time, Ahab\u2019s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to\r\nshreds.\r\n\n\r\nBut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and\r\nrecrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now\r\nfast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the devoted\r\nboats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment the whale drew\r\naside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge. Seizing that\r\nopportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and then was rapidly hauling and\r\njerking in upon it again\u2014hoping that way to disencumber it of some\r\nsnarls\u2014when lo!\u2014a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of\r\nsharks!\r\n\n\r\nCaught and twisted\u2014corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\r\nand lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing and\r\ndripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab\u2019s boat. Only one thing\r\ncould be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\r\nwithin\u2014through\u2014and then, without\u2014the rays of steel; dragged\r\nin the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice\r\nsundering the rope near the chocks\u2014dropped the intercepted fagot of steel\r\ninto the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\r\nsudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so doing,\r\nirresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his\r\nflukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and\r\nthen, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which,\r\nfor a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like\r\nthe grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.\r\n\n\r\nWhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after the\r\nrevolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope little\r\nFlask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs upwards to\r\nescape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some\r\none to ladle him up; and while the old man\u2019s line\u2014now\r\nparting\u2014admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he\r\ncould;\u2014in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted\r\nperils,\u2014Ahab\u2019s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven\r\nby invisible wires,\u2014as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the\r\nsea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and sent it,\r\nturning over and over, into the air; till it fell again\u2014gunwale\r\ndownwards\u2014and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like seals\r\nfrom a seaside cave.\r\n\n\r\nThe first uprising momentum of the whale\u2014modifying its direction as he\r\nstruck the surface\u2014involuntarily launched him along it, to a little\r\ndistance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his back to\r\nit, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side;\r\nand whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats\r\ntouched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and came sideways smiting the\r\nsea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed\r\nhis pleated forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled\r\nlines, continued his leeward way at a traveller\u2019s methodic pace.\r\n\n\r\nAs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came\r\nbearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating\r\nmariners, tubs, oars and whatever else could be caught at, and safely landed\r\nthem on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles; livid\r\ncontusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies of rope;\r\nshattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or even serious\r\nill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab\r\nwas now found grimly clinging to his boat\u2019s broken half, which afforded a\r\ncomparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day\u2019s\r\nmishap.\r\n\n\r\nBut when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as instead\r\nof standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck, who\r\nhad thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg had been snapped\r\noff, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye, Starbuck, \u2019tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner\r\nwho he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe ferrule has not stood, sir,\u201d said the carpenter, now coming\r\nup; \u201cI put good work into that leg.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut no bones broken, sir, I hope,\u201d said Stubb with true concern.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!\u2014d\u2019ye see\r\nit.\u2014But even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no\r\nliving bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that\u2019s lost. Nor\r\nwhite whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own\r\nproper and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape\r\nyonder roof?\u2014Aloft there! which way?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDead to leeward, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cUp helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of\r\nthe spare boats and rig them\u2014Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the\r\nboat\u2019s crews.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLet me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the\r\nunconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane\u2014there, that\r\nshivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet. By\r\nheaven it cannot be!\u2014missing?\u2014quick! call them all.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe old man\u2019s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the\r\nParsee was not there.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe Parsee!\u201d cried Stubb\u2014\u201che must have been caught\r\nin\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe black vomit wrench thee!\u2014run all of ye above, alow, cabin,\r\nforecastle\u2014find him\u2014not gone\u2014not gone!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere\r\nto be found.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, sir,\u201d said Stubb\u2014\u201ccaught among the tangles of\r\nyour line\u2014I thought I saw him dragging under.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cMy line! my line? Gone?\u2014gone? What means that little\r\nword?\u2014What death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were\r\nthe belfry. The harpoon, too!\u2014toss over the litter\r\nthere,\u2014d\u2019ye see it?\u2014the forged iron, men, the white\r\nwhale\u2019s\u2014no, no, no,\u2014blistered fool; this hand did dart\r\nit!\u2014\u2019tis in the fish!\u2014Aloft there! keep him\r\nnailed\u2014quick!\u2014all hands to the rigging of the boats\u2014collect\r\nthe oars\u2014harpooneers! the irons, the irons!\u2014hoist the royals\r\nhigher\u2014a pull on all the sheets!\u2014helm there! steady, steady for\r\nyour life! I\u2019ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive\r\nstraight through it, but I\u2019ll slay him yet!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGreat God! but for one single instant show thyself,\u201d cried\r\nStarbuck; \u201cnever, never wilt thou capture him, old man\u2014In\r\nJesus\u2019 name no more of this, that\u2019s worse than devil\u2019s\r\nmadness. Two days chased; twice stove to splinters; thy very leg once more\r\nsnatched from under thee; thy evil shadow gone\u2014all good angels mobbing\r\nthee with warnings:\u2014what more wouldst thou have?\u2014Shall we keep\r\nchasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by\r\nhim to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world?\r\nOh, oh,\u2014Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStarbuck, of late I\u2019ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since\r\nthat hour we both saw\u2014thou know\u2019st what, in one another\u2019s\r\neyes. But in this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the\r\npalm of this hand\u2014a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab,\r\nman. This whole act\u2019s immutably decreed. \u2019Twas rehearsed by thee\r\nand me a billion years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates\u2019\r\nlieutenant; I act under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest\r\nmine.\u2014Stand round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump;\r\nleaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. \u2019Tis\r\nAhab\u2014his body\u2019s part; but Ahab\u2019s soul\u2019s a centipede,\r\nthat moves upon a hundred legs. I feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that\r\ntow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so. But ere I break,\r\nye\u2019ll hear me crack; and till ye hear that, know that Ahab\u2019s\r\nhawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in the things called omens? Then\r\nlaugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they drown, drowning things will twice\r\nrise to the surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby\r\nDick\u2014two days he\u2019s floated\u2014to-morrow will be the third. Aye,\r\nmen, he\u2019ll rise once more,\u2014but only to spout his last! D\u2019ye\r\nfeel brave men, brave?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAs fearless fire,\u201d cried Stubb.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAnd as mechanical,\u201d muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward,\r\nhe muttered on:\u2014\u201cThe things called omens! And yesterday I talked\r\nthe same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek\r\nto drive out of others\u2019 hearts what\u2019s clinched so fast in\r\nmine!\u2014The Parsee\u2014the Parsee!\u2014gone, gone? and he was to go\r\nbefore:\u2014but still was to be seen again ere I could\r\nperish\u2014How\u2019s that?\u2014There\u2019s a riddle now might baffle\r\nall the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judges:\u2014like a\r\nhawk\u2019s beak it pecks my brain. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll solve it,\r\nthough!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nWhen dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.\r\n\n\r\nSo once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on the\r\nprevious night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the grindstone was\r\nheard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and\r\ncareful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the\r\nmorrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab\u2019s wrecked craft the\r\ncarpenter made him another leg; while still as on the night before, slouched\r\nAhab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly\r\ngone backward on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.CHAPTER CXXXV.THE CHASE\u2014THIRD DAY\n\r\nThe morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary\r\nnight-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight\r\nlook-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cD\u2019ye see him?\u201d cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in\r\nsight.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cIn his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that\u2019s all.\r\nHelm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day\r\nagain; were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the angels, and\r\nthis morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not\r\ndawn upon that world. Here\u2019s food for thought, had Ahab time to think;\r\nbut Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; that\u2019s\r\ntingling enough for mortal man! to think\u2019s audacity. God only has that\r\nright and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a calmness;\r\nand our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for that. And yet,\r\nI\u2019ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm\u2014frozen calm, this old\r\nskull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned to ice, and shiver\r\nit. And still this hair is growing now; this moment growing, and heat must\r\nbreed it; but no, it\u2019s like that sort of common grass that will grow\r\nanywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How\r\nthe wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails\r\nlash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere\r\nthis through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated\r\nthem, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Out upon\r\nit!\u2014it\u2019s tainted. Were I the wind, I\u2019d blow no more on such a\r\nwicked, miserable world. I\u2019d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink there.\r\nAnd yet, \u2019tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it?\r\nIn every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you\r\nbut run through it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will\r\nnot stand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing\u2014a nobler\r\nthing than that. Would now the wind but had a body; but all the things\r\nthat most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but\r\nonly bodiless as objects, not as agents. There\u2019s a most special, a most\r\ncunning, oh, a most malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it\r\nnow, that there\u2019s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These\r\nwarm Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in\r\nstrong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however\r\nthe baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of\r\nthe land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the\r\neternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these\r\nTrades, or something like them\u2014something so unchangeable, and full as\r\nstrong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d\u2019ye\r\nsee?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing, sir.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cNothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!\r\nAye, aye, it must be so. I\u2019ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,\r\nhe\u2019s chasing me now; not I, him\u2014that\u2019s bad; I\r\nmight have known it, too. Fool! the lines\u2014the harpoons he\u2019s towing.\r\nAye, aye, I have run him by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but\r\nthe regular look outs! Man the braces!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSteering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod\u2019s\r\nquarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship\r\nsailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAgainst the wind he now steers for the open jaw,\u201d murmured\r\nStarbuck to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail.\r\n\u201cGod keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the\r\ninside wet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStand by to sway me up!\u201d cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen\r\nbasket. \u201cWe should meet him soon.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d and straightway Starbuck did Ahab\u2019s bidding,\r\nand once more Ahab swung on high.\r\n\n\r\nA whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held long\r\nbreaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the weather bow,\r\nAhab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three mast-heads three\r\nshrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cForehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck\r\nthere!\u2014brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind\u2019s eye. He\u2019s\r\ntoo far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that\r\nhelmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me\r\nhave one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there\u2019s time for\r\nthat. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink\r\nsince I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The\r\nsame!\u2014the same!\u2014the same to Noah as to me. There\u2019s a soft\r\nshower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere\u2014to\r\nsomething else than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white\r\nwhale goes that way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer\r\nquarter. But good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What\u2019s this?\u2014green?\r\naye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on\r\nAhab\u2019s head! There\u2019s the difference now between man\u2019s old age\r\nand matter\u2019s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our\r\nhulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that\u2019s all. By\r\nheaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way. I can\u2019t\r\ncompare with it; and I\u2019ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the\r\nlives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers. What\u2019s that\r\nhe said? he should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But\r\nwhere? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those\r\nendless stairs? and all night I\u2019ve been sailing from him, wherever he did\r\nsink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told\u2019st direful truth as touching\r\nthyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good by,\r\nmast-head\u2014keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I\u2019m gone.\r\nWe\u2019ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down\r\nthere, tied by head and tail.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHe gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the\r\ncloven blue air to the deck.\r\n\n\r\nIn due time the boats were lowered, but as standing in his shallop\u2019s\r\nstern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the\r\nmate,\u2014who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck\u2014and bade him pause.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStarbuck!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSir?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cFor the third time my soul\u2019s ship starts upon this voyage,\r\nStarbuck.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cAye, sir, thou wilt have it so.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSome ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,\r\nStarbuck!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cTruth, sir: saddest truth.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cSome men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the\r\nflood;\u2014and I feel now like a billow that\u2019s all one crested comb,\r\nStarbuck. I am old;\u2014shake hands with me, man.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nTheir hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck\u2019s tears the glue.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh, my captain, my captain!\u2014noble heart\u2014go not\u2014go\r\nnot!\u2014see, it\u2019s a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the\r\npersuasion then!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cLower away!\u201d\u2014cried Ahab, tossing the mate\u2019s arm from\r\nhim. \u201cStand by the crew!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nIn an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe sharks! the sharks!\u201d cried a voice from the low cabin-window\r\nthere; \u201cO master, my master, come back!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the boat\r\nleaped on.\r\n\n\r\nYet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when numbers\r\nof sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull,\r\nmaliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they dipped in the\r\nwater; and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites. It is a thing not\r\nuncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at\r\ntimes apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover\r\nover the banners of marching regiments in the east. But these were the first\r\nsharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been\r\nfirst descried; and whether it was that Ahab\u2019s crew were all such\r\ntiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of\r\nthe sharks\u2014a matter sometimes well known to affect them,\u2014however it\r\nwas, they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHeart of wrought steel!\u201d murmured Starbuck gazing over the side,\r\nand following with his eyes the receding boat\u2014\u201ccanst thou yet ring\r\nboldly to that sight?\u2014lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and\r\nfollowed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third\r\nday?\u2014For when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit;\r\nbe sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the\r\nevening and the end of that thing\u2014be that end what it may. Oh! my God!\r\nwhat is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet\r\nexpectant,\u2014fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,\r\nas in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim. Mary,\r\ngirl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see but thy eyes\r\ngrown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but clouds sweep\r\nbetween\u2014Is my journey\u2019s end coming? My legs feel faint; like his\r\nwho has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,\u2014beats it yet?\u2014Stir\r\nthyself, Starbuck!\u2014stave it off\u2014move, move! speak\r\naloud!\u2014Mast-head there! See ye my boy\u2019s hand on the\r\nhill?\u2014Crazed;\u2014aloft there!\u2014keep thy keenest eye upon the\r\nboats:\u2014mark well the whale!\u2014Ho! again!\u2014drive off that hawk!\r\nsee! he pecks\u2014he tears the vane\u201d\u2014pointing to the red flag\r\nflying at the main-truck\u2014\u201cHa! he soars away with\r\nit!\u2014Where\u2019s the old man now? sees\u2019t thou that sight, oh\r\nAhab!\u2014shudder, shudder!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads\u2014a\r\ndownward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but intending to be\r\nnear him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways from the\r\nvessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence, as the\r\nhead-beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cDrive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads, drive\r\nthem in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no hearse can\r\nbe mine:\u2014and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSuddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then quickly\r\nupheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising\r\nto the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a subterraneous hum; and then\r\nall held their breaths; as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and\r\nlances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a\r\nthin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and\r\nthen fell swamping back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters\r\nflashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower\r\nof flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble\r\ntrunk of the whale.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cGive way!\u201d cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward\r\nto the attack; but maddened by yesterday\u2019s fresh irons that corroded in\r\nhim, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from\r\nheaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white\r\nforehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he\r\ncame churning his tail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart;\r\nspilling out the irons and lances from the two mates\u2019 boats, and dashing\r\nin one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab\u2019s almost\r\nwithout a scar.\r\n\n\r\nWhile Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the whale\r\nswimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he shot by them\r\nagain; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and round to the\r\nfish\u2019s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past\r\nnight, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him, the half\r\ntorn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his\r\ndistended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.\r\n\n\r\nThe harpoon dropped from his hand.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBefooled, befooled!\u201d\u2014drawing in a long lean\r\nbreath\u2014\u201cAye, Parsee! I see thee again.\u2014Aye, and thou goest\r\nbefore; and this, this then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I\r\nhold thee to the last letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away,\r\nmates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time,\r\nand return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die\u2014Down, men! the first\r\nthing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon.\r\nYe are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey\r\nme.\u2014Where\u2019s the whale? gone down again?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse\r\nhe bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a\r\nstage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward;\r\nand had almost passed the ship,\u2014which thus far had been sailing in the\r\ncontrary direction to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.\r\nHe seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing\r\nhis own straight path in the sea.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOh! Ahab,\u201d cried Starbuck, \u201cnot too late is it, even now,\r\nthe third day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that\r\nmadly seekest him!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nSetting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to\r\nleeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by the\r\nvessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck\u2019s face as he leaned\r\nover the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not too\r\nswiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg,\r\nand Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were\r\nrocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side,\r\nand were busily at work in repairing them. One after the other, through the\r\nportholes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask,\r\nbusying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all\r\nthis; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed\r\ndriving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or\r\nflag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just\r\ngained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails,\r\nand so nail it to the mast.\r\n\n\r\nWhether fagged by the three days\u2019 running chase, and the resistance to\r\nhis swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent\r\ndeceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale\u2019s\r\nway now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once\r\nmore; though indeed the whale\u2019s last start had not been so long a one as\r\nbefore. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks\r\naccompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so continually\r\nbit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and crunched, and left\r\nsmall splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cHeed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on!\r\n\u2019tis the better rest, the shark\u2019s jaw than the yielding\r\nwater.\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cBut at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThey will last long enough! pull on!\u2014But who can\r\ntell\u201d\u2014he muttered\u2014\u201cwhether these sharks swim to feast\r\non the whale or on Ahab?\u2014But pull on! Aye, all alive, now\u2014we near\r\nhim. The helm! take the helm; let me pass,\u201d\u2014and so saying, two of\r\nthe oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.\r\n\n\r\nAt length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with the\r\nWhite Whale\u2019s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\r\nadvance\u2014as the whale sometimes will\u2014and Ahab was fairly within the\r\nsmoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale\u2019s spout, curled\r\nround his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when, with body\r\narched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted his\r\nfierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale. As both steel and\r\ncurse sank to the socket, as if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways\r\nwrithed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without\r\nstaving a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been\r\nfor the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once\r\nmore have been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen\u2014who\r\nforeknew not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for\r\nits effects\u2014these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of\r\nthem clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing wave,\r\nhurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping\r\nastern, but still afloat and swimming.\r\n\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated, instantaneous\r\nswiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea. But when Ahab\r\ncried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line, and hold it so; and\r\ncommanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and tow the boat up to the\r\nmark; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it\r\nsnapped in the empty air!\r\n\n\r\n\u201cWhat breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!\u2014\u2019tis whole again;\r\noars! oars! Burst in upon him!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nHearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled round\r\nto present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution, catching sight of\r\nthe nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in it the source of all\r\nhis persecutions; bethinking it\u2014it may be\u2014a larger and nobler foe;\r\nof a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery\r\nshowers of foam.\r\n\n\r\nAhab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. \u201cI grow blind; hands!\r\nstretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is\u2019t night?\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe whale! The ship!\u201d cried the cringing oarsmen.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cOars! oars Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever\r\ntoo late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark; I see: the ship!\r\nthe ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?\u201d\r\n\n\r\nBut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge-hammering\r\nseas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks burst through, and in an\r\ninstant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves;\r\nits half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the\r\npouring water.\r\n\n\r\nMeantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego\u2019s mast-head hammer\r\nremained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as with a\r\nplaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own forward-flowing\r\nheart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath, caught\r\nsight of the down-coming monster just as soon as he.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air,\r\nnow hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman\u2019s\r\nfainting fit. Up helm, I say\u2014ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the end\r\nof all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo,\r\nthy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm again! He turns to meet\r\nus! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he\r\ncannot depart. My God, stand by me now!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cStand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help\r\nStubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Who\r\never helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb\u2019s own unwinking eye?\r\nAnd now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would it\r\nwere stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun,\r\nmoon, and stars! I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his\r\nghost. For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the\r\ncup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there\u2019ll be plenty of\r\ngulping soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let\r\nStubb die in his drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death,\r\nthough;\u2014cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere\r\nwe die!\u201d\r\n\n\r\n\u201cCherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope my\r\npoor mother\u2019s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will now\r\ncome to her, for the voyage is up.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nFrom the ship\u2019s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,\r\nbits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their hands, just\r\nas they had darted from their various employments; all their enchanted eyes\r\nintent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely vibrating his\r\npredestinating head, sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam\r\nbefore him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in\r\nhis whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid white\r\nbuttress of his forehead smote the ship\u2019s starboard bow, till men and\r\ntimbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the\r\nheads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the\r\nbreach, they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cThe ship! The hearse!\u2014the second hearse!\u201d cried Ahab from\r\nthe boat; \u201cits wood could only be American!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nDiving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel; but\r\nturning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the other bow,\r\nbut within a few yards of Ahab\u2019s boat, where, for a time, he lay\r\nquiescent.\r\n\n\r\n\u201cI turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! Let me hear thy hammer.\r\nOh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only\r\ngod-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed\r\nprow,\u2014death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I cut\r\noff from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death\r\non lonely life! Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief.\r\nHo, ho! from all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my\r\nwhole foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I\r\nroll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with\r\nthee; from hell\u2019s heart I stab at thee; for hate\u2019s sake I spit my\r\nlast breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool! and\r\nsince neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee,\r\nthough tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up the\r\nspear!\u201d\r\n\n\r\nThe harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting velocity\r\nthe line ran through the groove;\u2014ran foul. Ahab stooped to clear it; he\r\ndid clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the neck, and voicelessly as\r\nTurkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew\r\nknew he was gone. Next instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope\u2019s final\r\nend flew out of the stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the\r\nsea, disappeared in its depths.\r\n\n\r\nFor an instant, the tranced boat\u2019s crew stood still; then turned.\r\n\u201cThe ship? Great God, where is the ship?\u201d Soon they through dim,\r\nbewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata\r\nMorgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or\r\nfidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers still\r\nmaintained their sinking lookouts on the sea. And now, concentric circles\r\nseized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every\r\nlance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all round and round in one\r\nvortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.\r\n\n\r\nBut as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head\r\nof the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet\r\nvisible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly\r\nundulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost\r\ntouched;\u2014at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly\r\nuplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster\r\nto the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck\r\ndownwards from its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and\r\nincommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad\r\nfluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling\r\nthat etherial thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his\r\nhammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and\r\nhis imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag\r\nof Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell\r\ntill she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and helmeted\r\nherself with it.\r\n\n\r\nNow small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white surf\r\nbeat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the\r\nsea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.\r\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\r\n\u201cAND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE.\u201d\r\n\n\r\nJob.\r\n\n\nThe drama\u2019s done. Why then here does any one step forth?\u2014Because\r\none did survive the wreck.\n\n\nIt so chanced, that after the Parsee\u2019s disappearance, I was he whom\r\nthe Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab\u2019s bowsman, when that bowsman\r\nassumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men were\r\ntossed from out the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating on the\r\nmargin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the half-spent\r\nsuction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the\r\nclosing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and\r\nround, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the\r\naxis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till,\r\ngaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by\r\nreason of its cunning spring, and owing to its great buoyancy, rising with\r\ngreat force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and\r\nfloated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and\r\nnight, I floated on a soft and dirge-like main. The unharming sharks, they\r\nglided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with\r\nsheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up\r\nat last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after\r\nher missing children, only found another orphan."}
